<h1>Definition 18</h1>
<div class="statement">When a right triangle with one side of those
about the right angle remains fixed is carried round and restored
again to the same position from which it began to be moved, the
figure so comprehended is a cone. And, if the straight line which
remains fixed equals the remaining side about the right angle which
is carried round, the cone will be right-angled; if less,
obtuse-angled; and if greater, acute-angled.</div>

<div class="theorem">
<h1>Definition 19</h1>
<div class="statement">The axis of the cone is the straight line
which remains fixed and about which the triangle is turned.</div>

<div class="theorem">
<h1>Definition 20</h1>
<div class="statement">And the base is the circle described by the
straight line which is carried round.</div>

<td>The right triangle <i>ABC</i> with right angle at <i>A</i> is
rotated about the side <i>AC</i> to produce a cone. The axis of the
cone is <i>AC,</i> and its base is the circle with center at
<i>A</i> and radius <i>AB.</i>
<p>The three different kinds of cone are not used by Euclid in the
<i>Elements,</i> but they were important in the theory of conic
sections until Apollonius’ work <i>Conics.</i> In Euclid’s time
conic sections were taken as the intersections of a plane at right
angles to an edge (straight line from the vertex) of a cone. When
the cone is acute-angled, the section is an ellipse; when
right-angled, a parabola; and when obtuse-angle, a hyperbola. Even
the names of these three curves were given by the kind of angle,
so, for instance, Euclid knew a parabola as a “section of a
right-angled cone.” It was Apollonius who named them ellipse,
parabola, and hyperbola.</p>
