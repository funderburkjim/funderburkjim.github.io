<div class="theorem">
<h1>Definition 5</h1>
<div class="statement">The inclination of a straight line to a
plane is, assuming a perpendicular drawn from the end of the
straight line which is elevated above the plane to the plane, and a
straight line joined from the point thus arising to the end of the
straight line which is in the plane, the angle contained by the
straight line so drawn and the straight line standing up.</div>

<h2>Guide</h2>
Although definition 3 states that a line needs to be at right
angles with all of the straight lines which meet it and lie in the
plane, proposition <a href="propXI4.html">XI.4</a> states that it
is only necessary that a straight line be at right angles to two
lines in the plane in order that it be at right angles to all the
rest.
<p>There is an implicit assumption in definition 3 as it speaks of
a straight line making right angles with straight lines which meet
it and are in the plane. The concept of two lines making a right
angle assumes that the two sides of the angles lie in one plane,
that is, that two intersecting lines lie in a plane, a statement
that is supposedly verified in proposition <a href="propXI2.html">XI.2</a>.</p>
<p>The concept of a line being perpendicular to a plane is central
to solid geometry. It is developed and used in many propositions in
Book XI, starting with <a href="propXI4.html">XI.4</a>.</p>
<p>There is also an implicit assumption in definition 4, namely
that the intersection of the two planes is a straight line, a
statement that is supposedly verified in proposition <a href="propXI3.html">XI.3</a>. The concept of planes perpendicular to
planes first appears inproposition <a href="propXI18.html">XI.18</a> which states that if <i>one</i> straight
line drawn in one of the planes is at right angles to the other
plane, then the two planes are at perpendicular.</p>
<p>Definition 5 is meant to define the inclination (angle) between
a line and a plane as the angle between that line and the
projection of it in the plane. This requires that there is a line
at right angles to a plane from a point not on the plane which is
assured by proposition <a href="propXI11.html">XI.11</a>. It also
requires that the angle constructed in the definition is
independent of the construction.</p>
