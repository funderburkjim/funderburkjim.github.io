<h1>Proposition 7</h1>
<div class="statement">If two straight lines are parallel and
points are taken at random on each of them, then the straight line
joining the points is in the same plane with the parallel straight
lines.</div>
<p>Let <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> be two parallel straight lines, and
let points <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> be taken at random on them
respectively.</p>

<p>I say that the straight line joining the points <i>E</i> and
<i>F</i> lies in the same plane with the parallel straight
lines.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="propXI3.html">XI.3</a></div>
<p>For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let it be in a more
elevated plane as <i>EGF.</i> Draw a plane through <i>EGF.</i> Its
intersection with the plane of reference is a straight line. Let it
be <i>EF.</i></p>
<p>Therefore the two straight lines <i>EGF</i> and <i>EF</i>
enclose an area, which is impossible. Therefore the straight line
joined from <i>E</i> to <i>F</i> is not in a plane more elevated.
Therefore the straight line joined from <i>E</i> to <i>F</i> lies
in the plane through the parallel straight lines <i>AB</i> and
<i>CD.</i></p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if two straight lines are parallel and points are
taken at random on each of them, then the straight line joining the
points is in the same plane with the parallel straight
lines.</i></p>

<h2>Guide</h2>
The existence of this proposition is a good argument that Euclidâ€™s
definition <a href="../bookI/defI7.html">I.Def.7</a> of a plane (it
lies evenly with the straight lines on itself) does not mean that
if two points lie in a plane, then the line joining them also lies
in the plane. If it did, then this proposition would be true by
definition, and no proof would be required at all.
<p>Note that this proof assumes that every line lies in a plane, a
conclusion that has not been justified.</p>
<h4>Use of this proposition</h4>
This proposition is used in the proof of the next as well as
proposition <a href="../bookXII/propXII17.html">XII.17</a>.
