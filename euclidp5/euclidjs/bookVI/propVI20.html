<h1>Proposition 20</h1>
<div class="statement">Similar polygons are divided into similar

<p>Let <i>ABCDE</i> and <i>FGHKL</i> be similar polygons, and let

<p>I say that the polygons <i>ABCDE</i> and <i>FGHKL</i> are
divided into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in
multitude and in the same ratio as the wholes, and the polygon

<div class="just"><a href="defVI1.html">VI.Def.1</a></div>
<p>Now, since the polygon <i>ABCDE</i> is similar to the polygon
<i>FGHKL,</i> therefore the angle <i>BAE</i> equals the angle
<i>GFL,</i> and <i>AB</i> is to <i>AE</i> as <i>GF</i> is to
<i>FL.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propVI6.html">VI.6</a><br />
<a href="propVI4.html">VI.4</a><br />
<a href="defVI1.html">VI.Def.1</a></div>
<p>Since then <i>ABE</i> and <i>FGL</i> are two triangles having
one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles
proportional, therefore the triangle <i>ABE</i> is equiangular with
the triangle <i>FGL,</i> so that it is also similar, therefore the
angle <i>ABE</i> equals the angle <i>FGL.</i></p>
<p>But the whole angle <i>ABC</i> also equals the whole angle
<i>FGH</i> because of the similarity of the polygons, therefore the
remaining angle <i>EBC</i> equals the angle <i>LGH.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV22.html">V.22</a><br />
<a href="propVI6.html">VI.6</a><br />
<a href="propVI4.html">VI.4</a><br />
<a href="defVI1.html">VI.Def.1</a></div>
<p>And, since the triangles <i>ABE</i> and <i>FGL</i> are similar,
<i>BE</i> is to <i>AB</i> as <i>GL</i> is to <i>GF.</i> Also, since
the polygons are similar, <i>AB</i> is to <i>BC</i> as <i>FG</i> is
to <i>GH.</i> Therefore, <i>ex aequali, BE</i> is to <i>BC</i> as
<i>GL</i> is to <i>GH,</i> that is, the sides about the equal
angles <i>EBC</i> and <i>LGH</i> are proportional. Therefore the
triangle <i>EBC</i> is equiangular with the triangle <i>LGH,</i> so
that the triangle <i>EBC</i> is also similar to the triangle
<i>LGH.</i></p>
<p>For the same reason the triangle <i>ECD</i> is also similar to
the triangle <i>LHK.</i></p>
<p>Therefore the similar polygons <i>ABCDE</i> and <i>FGHKL</i>
have been divided into similar triangles, and into triangles equal
in multitude.</p>
<p>I say that they are also in the same ratio as the wholes, that
is, in such manner that the triangles are proportional, and <i>ABE,
EBC,</i> and <i>ECD</i> are antecedents, while <i>FGL, LGH,</i> and
<i>LHK</i> are their consequents, and that the polygon <i>ABCDE</i>
has to the polygon <i>FGHKL</i> a ratio duplicate of that which the
corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is <i>AB</i>
to <i>FG.</i></p>
<p>Join <i>AC</i> and <i>FH.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propVI6.html">VI.6</a></div>
<p>Then since the polygons are similar, the angle <i>ABC</i> equals
the angle <i>FGH,</i> and <i>AB</i> is to <i>BC</i> as <i>FG</i> is
to <i>GH,</i> the triangle <i>ABC</i> is equiangular with the
triangle <i>FGH,</i> therefore the angle <i>BAC</i> equals the
angle <i>GFH,</i> and the angle <i>BCA</i> to the angle
<i>GHF.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI32.html">I.32</a></div>
<p>And, since the angle <i>BAM</i> equals the angle <i>GFN,</i> and
the angle <i>ABM</i> also equals the angle <i>FGN,</i> therefore
the remaining angle <i>AMB</i> also equals the remaining angle
<i>FNG.</i> Therefore the triangle <i>ABM</i> is equiangular with
the triangle <i>FGN.</i></p>
<p>Similarly we can prove that the triangle <i>BMC</i> is also
equiangular with the triangle <i>GNH.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV22.html">V.22</a></div>
<p>Therefore, proportionally, <i>AM</i> is to <i>MB</i> as
<i>FN</i> is to <i>NG,</i> and <i>BM</i> is to <i>MC</i> as
<i>GN</i> is to <i>NH.</i> So that, in addition, <i>ex aequali,
AM</i> is to <i>MC</i> as <i>FN</i> is to <i>NH.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propVI1.html">VI.1</a></div>
<p>But <i>AM</i> is to <i>MC</i> as the triangle <i>ABM</i> is to
<i>MBC,</i> and as <i>AME</i> is to <i>EMC,</i> for they are to one
another as their bases.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV12.html">V.12</a></div>
<p>Therefore also one of the antecedents is to one of the
consequents as are all the antecedents to all the consequents,
therefore the triangle <i>AMB</i> is to <i>BMC</i> as <i>ABE</i> is
to <i>CBE.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV11.html">V.11</a></div>
<p>But <i>AMB</i> is to <i>BMC</i> as <i>AM</i> is to <i>MC,</i>
therefore <i>AM</i> is to <i>MC</i> as the triangle <i>ABE</i> is
to the triangle <i>EBC.</i></p>
<p>For the same reason also <i>FN</i> is to <i>NH</i> as the
triangle <i>FGL</i> is to the triangle <i>GLH.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV11.html">V.11</a><br />
<a href="../bookV/propV16.html">V.16</a></div>
<p>And <i>AM</i> is to <i>MC</i> as <i>FN</i> is to <i>NH,</i>
therefore the triangle <i>ABE</i> is to the triangle <i>BEC</i> as
the triangle <i>FGL</i> is to the triangle <i>GLH,</i> and,
alternately, the triangle <i>ABE</i> is to the triangle <i>FGL</i>
as the triangle <i>BEC</i> is to the triangle <i>GLH.</i></p>
<p>Similarly we can prove, if <i>BD</i> and <i>GK</i> are joined,
that the triangle <i>BEC</i> is to the triangle <i>LGH</i> as the
triangle <i>ECD</i> is to the triangle <i>LHK.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV12.html">V.12</a></div>
<p>And since the triangle <i>ABE</i> is to the triangle <i>FGL</i>
as <i>EBC</i> is to <i>LGH,</i> and further as <i>ECD</i> is to
<i>LHK,</i> therefore also one of the antecedents is to one of the
consequents as the sum of the antecedents to the sum of the
consequents. Therefore the triangle <i>ABE</i> is to the triangle
<i>FGL</i> as the polygon <i>ABCDE</i> is to the polygon
<i>FGHKL.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propVI19.html">VI.19</a></div>
<p>But the triangle <i>ABE</i> has to the triangle <i>FGL</i> a
ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side <i>AB</i> has
to the corresponding side <i>FG,</i> for similar triangles are in
the duplicate ratio of the corresponding sides.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV11.html">V.11</a></div>
<p>Therefore the polygon <i>ABCDE</i> also has to the polygon
<i>FGHKL</i> a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side
<i>AB</i> has to the corresponding side <i>FG.</i></p>
<p>Therefore, <i>similar polygons are divided into similar
triangles, and into triangles equal in multitude and in the same
ratio as the wholes, and the polygon has to the polygon a ratio
duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the
corresponding side.</i></p>

<h1>Corollary</h1>
<div class="statement">Similarly also it can be proved in the case
of quadrilaterals that they are in the duplicate ratio of the
corresponding sides. And it was also proved in the case of
triangles, therefore also, generally, similar rectilinear figures
are to one another in the duplicate ratio of the corresponding
sides.</div>
