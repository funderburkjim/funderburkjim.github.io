<h1>Definitions 15–19</h1>
<div class="statement">
<p>15. A number is said to <i>multiply</i> a number when the latter
is added as many times as there are units in the former.</p>
<p>16. And, when two numbers having multiplied one another make
some number, the number so produced be called <i>plane,</i> and its
<i>sides</i> are the numbers which have multiplied one another.</p>
<p>17. And, when three numbers having multiplied one another make
some number, the number so produced be called <i>solid,</i> and its
<i>sides</i> are the numbers which have multiplied one another.</p>
<p>18. A <i>square number</i> is equal multiplied by equal, or a
number which is contained by two equal numbers.</p>
<p>19. And a <i>cube</i> is equal multiplied by equal and again by
equal, or a number which is contained by three equal numbers.</p>

<p>Notice that Euclid doesn’t define addition and subtraction. For
an example where addition of numbers appears, see <a href="propVII28.html">VII.28</a>. Formal definitions for them could be
given, but those operations are assumed to be understood in the
same way that any number <i>a</i> is a multiple of units
<i>u</i>.</p>
<p>Multiplication and proportion are formally defined, and
proportion is defined next in <a href="defVII20.html">VII.Def.20</a>.</p>
<h4>On Definition 15</h4>
Definition 15 defines multiplication in terms of addition as a kind
of composition. For instance, to multiply
<i>a</i> = 4<i>u</i> and <i>b</i> = 5<i>u</i>,
since <i>a</i> consists of 4 units, add 4 <i>b</i>’s together, that
is, add 5<i>u</i>, 5<i>u</i>, 5<i>u</i>, and 5<i>u</i>.
<p>Note that Euclid did not think of addition as a binary
operation, but as an operation with any number of arguments.
Definition 15 uses the informal operation of addition to define the
formal operation of multiplication.</p>
<p>The first proposition on multiplication is <a href="propVII16.html">VII.16</a> which says multiplication is
commutative. For our example, that would say <i>a</i> times
<i>b</i> equals <i>b</i> times <i>a</i>. Since
<i>b</i> = 5<i>u</i> and <i>a</i> = 4<i>u</i>,
therefore <i>b</i> times <i>a</i> requires adding 4<i>u</i>,
4<i>u</i>, 4<i>u</i>, 4<i>u</i>, and 4<i>u</i>.</p>
<h4>Figurate numbers</h4>
<p>Although Euclid never displays numbers except as lines, the
Pythagoreans before him evidently did, that is, they displayed
numbers as figures. The figures were in various shapes, such as
triangles, squares, and so forth. Definitions 16 through 19 deal
with figurate numbers, but without the figures.</p>

<p>Euclid defines a plane number as a number which is the product
of two numbers. Remember that for Euclid, 1 is the unit, not a
number, so a prime number is not a plane number, even though it is
a product of 1 and itself.</p>
<p>Plane numbers are the composite numbers. Each composite number
can be a plane number in at least one way, but most in more than
one way. For instance, 16 can be viewed as a plane number either
with sides 2 and 8 or with sides 4 and 4, that is, as a square
number.</p>
<p>Plane numbers can be displayed as rectangular configurations of
dots as the plane number 6 times 3 is illustrated on the left.
Alternatively, these “rectangular numbers” can be displayed as a
configuration of squares on the right. But most of the other
figurate numbers, such as triangular numbers, could only easily be
displayed by dots.</p>

<p>Perhaps for the Pythagoreans, the most important figures were
the triangular numbers: 3, 6, especially 10, 15, 21, etc. Each
could be formed from the previous by adding a new row one unit
longer. So, for instance,
10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4. For
some reason, Euclid doesn’t mention triangular numbers. Indeed, he
doesn’t address sums of arithmetic progressions at all, a subject
of interest in many ancient cultures. Euclid does give the sum of a
geometric progression, that is, a continued proportion, in
proposition <a href="../bookIX/propIX35.html">IX.35</a>.</p>

<p>Definition 18 defines solid numbers. For example, if 18 is
presented as 3 times 3 times 2, then it is given as a solid number
with three sides 3, 3, and 2. Solid numbers can be represented as a
configuration of dots or cubes in three dimensions.</p>
<p>Squares and cubes are are described as certain symmetric plane
and solid numbers. Of course, some numbers, such as 64, can be
simultaneously squares and cubes.</p>
