<p>Prime numbers form a very important class of numbers, and much
of number theory is devoted to their analysis. The only proper
divisor of a prime number is 1. The first few prime numbers are, of
course, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Those numbers that aren’t prime are
composite, for instance, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10. The number 1 holds a
special position. For Euclid, it was the unit rather than a number.
For modern mathematicians 1 is also a unit, but in a different
sense of the word, since it has a reciprocal, namely, itself.</p>
<p>Numbers are relatively prime if their only common divisor is 1.
For example, 6 and 35 are relatively prime (although neither is a
prime number in itself). This situation is also phrased as “6 is
prime to 35.” For another example, the three numbers 6, 10, and 15
are relatively prime since no number (except 1) divides all three.
If the numbers aren’t relatively prime, then they’re called
“relatively composite,” a rarely used term.</p>
