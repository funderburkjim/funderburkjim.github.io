<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
Book VII is the first of the three books on number theory. It
begins with the 22 definitions used throughout these books. The
important definitions are those for unit and number, part and
multiple, even and odd, prime and relatively prime, proportion, and
perfect number. The topics in Book VII are antenaresis and the
greatest common divisor, proportions of numbers, relatively prime
numbers and prime numbers, and the least common multiple.
<p>The basic construction for Book VII is <i>antenaresis,</i> also
called the <i>Euclidean algorithm,</i> a kind of reciprocal
subtraction. Beginning with two numbers, the smaller, whichever it
is, is repeatedly subtracted from the larger until a single number
is left. This algorithm, studied in propositions <a href="propVII1.html">VII.1</a> through VII.3, results in the greatest
common divisor of two or more numbers.</p>
<p>Propositions <a href="propVII5.html">V.5</a> through V.10
develop properties of fractions, that is, they study how many parts
one number is of another in preparation for ratios and
proportions.</p>
<p>The next group of propositions <a href="propVII11.html">VII.11</a> through VII.19 develop the theory of
proportions for numbers.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em"><a href="propVII11.html">VII.11</a>.
<i>a</i> : <i>b</i> = <i>c</i> : <i>d</i> implies both equal the
ratio <i>a</i> – <i>c</i> : <i>b</i> – <i>d.</i><br />
<a href="propVII12.html">VII.12</a>. <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> = <i>c</i>
: <i>d</i> implies both equal the ratio <i>a</i> + <i>c</i> :
<i>b</i> + <i>d.</i><br />
<a href="propVII13.html">VII.13</a>. <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> = <i>c</i>
: <i>d</i> implies <i>a</i> : <i>c</i> = <i>b</i> : <i>d.</i><br />
<a href="propVII14.html">VII.14</a>. <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> = <i>d</i>

<a href="propVII19.html">VII.19</a>. <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> = <i>c</i>
: <i>d</i> if an only if <i>ad</i> = <i>bc.</i></div>
<p>Propositions <a href="propVII20.html">VII.20</a> through VII.29
discuss representing ratios in lowest terms as relatively prime
numbers and properties of relatively prime numbers. Properties of
prime numbers are presented in propositions <a href="propVII30.html">VII.30</a> through VII.32. Book VII finishes with
least common multiples in propositions <a href="propVII33.html">VII.33</a> through VII.39.</p>
<h4>Postulates for numbers</h4>
Postulates are as necessary for numbers as they are for geometry.
Euclid, however, supplies none. Missing postulates occurs as early
as proposition <a href="propVII2.html">VII.2</a>. In its proof,
Euclid constructs a decreasing sequence of whole positive numbers,
and, apparently, uses a principle to conclude that the sequence
must stop, that is, there cannot be an infinite decreasing sequence
of numbers. If that is the principle he uses, then it ought to be
stated as a postulate for numbers.
<p>Numbers are so familiar that it hardly occurs to us that the
theory of numbers needs axioms, too. In fact, that field was one of
the last to receive a careful scrutiny, and axioms for numbers
weren’t developed until the late 19th century by Dedekind and
others. By that time foundations for the rest of mathematics were
laid upon either geometry or number theory or both, and only
geometry had axioms. About the same time that foundations for
number theory were developed, a new subject, set theory, was
created by Dedekind and Cantor, and mathematics was refounded in
terms of set theory.</p>
<p>The foundations of number theory will be discussed in the Guides
to the various definitions and propositions.</p>
