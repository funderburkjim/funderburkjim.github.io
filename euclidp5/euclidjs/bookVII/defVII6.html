<h4>On Definition 6</h4>
<p>The definition even number is clear: the number <i>a</i> is even
if it is of the form <i>b</i> + <i>b.</i> The first few
even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.</p>
<h4>On Definition 7</h4>
<p>The definition for odd number has two statements. The first can
be taken as a definition of odd number, a number which is not
divisible into two equal parts, that is to say not an even number.
The first few odd numbers are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Euclid did not treat
1 as a number, but now 1 is also considered an odd number.</p>
<p>The other statement is not a definition for odd number, since
one has already been given, but an unproved statement. It is easy
to recognize that something has to be proved, since if we make the
analogous definitions for another number, say 10, then analogous
statement is false. Suppose we say a “decade number” is one
divisible by 10, and and “undecade number” is one not divisible by
10. Then it is not the case that an undecade number differs by a
unit from a decade number; the number 13, for instance, is not
within 1 of a decade number.</p>
<p>The unproved statement that a number differing from an even
number by 1 is an odd number ought to be proved. That statement is
used in proposition <a href="../bookIX/propIX22.html">IX.22</a> and
several propositions that follow it. It could be proved using, for
instance, a principle that any decreasing sequence of numbers is
finite.</p>
<h4>Definitions 8–10</h4>
These are also clear. A product of two even numbers is an
even-times-even number. The first few are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20. They
are all multiples of 4.
<p>A product of an even and an odd number is an even-times-odd
number. The first few are 6, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20. Note that a number
like 12 is both even-times-even and even-times-odd being at the
same time 2 times 6 and 4 times 3.</p>
<p>The numbers which are even-times-even but not even-times-odd are
just the powers of 2, namely, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. These are the
numbers which are even-times-even only, and they occur in
proposition <a href="../bookIX/propIX32.html">IX.32</a>.</p>
<p>A product of of two odd numbers is an odd-times-odd number. The
first few are 9, 15, 21, 25, 27.</p>
