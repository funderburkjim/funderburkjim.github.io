<dd>Any pyramid with a triangular base is divided into two pyramids
equal and similar to one another, similar to the whole, and having
triangular bases, and into two equal prisms, and the two prisms are
greater than half of the whole pyramid.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propXII4.html">Proposition 4</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If there are two pyramids of the same height with triangular
bases, and each of them is divided into two pyramids equal and
similar to one another and similar to the whole, and into two equal
prisms, then the base of the one pyramid is to the base of the
other pyramid as all the prisms in the one pyramid are to all the
prisms, being equal in multitude, in the other pyramid.
