<dt><b><a href="propIX1.html">Proposition 1</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If two similar plane numbers multiplied by one another make
some number, then the product is square.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX2.html">Proposition 2</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If two numbers multiplied by one another make a square number,
then they are similar plane numbers.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX3.html">Proposition 3</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If a cubic number multiplied by itself makes some number, then
the product is a cube.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX4.html">Proposition 4</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If a cubic number multiplied by a cubic number makes some
number, then the product is a cube.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX5.html">Proposition 5</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If a cubic number multiplied by any number makes a cubic
number, then the multiplied number is also cubic.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX6.html">Proposition 6</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If a number multiplied by itself makes a cubic number, then it
itself is also cubic.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX7.html">Proposition 7</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If a composite number multiplied by any number makes some
number, then the product is solid.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX8.html">Proposition 8</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in
continued proportion, then the third from the unit is square as are
also those which successively leave out one, the fourth is cubic as
are also all those which leave out two, and the seventh is at once
cubic and square are also those which leave out five.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX9.html">Proposition 9</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in
continued proportion, and the number after the unit is square, then
all the rest are also square; and if the number after the unit is
cubic, then all the rest are also cubic.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX10.html">Proposition 10</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in
continued proportion, and the number after the unit is not square,
then neither is any other square except the third from the unit and
all those which leave out one; and, if the number after the unit is
not cubic, then neither is any other cubic except the fourth from
the unit and all those which leave out two.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX11.html">Proposition 11</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in
continued proportion, then the less measures the greater according
to some one of the numbers which appear among the proportional
numbers.
<p><b><a href="propIX11.html#cor">Corollary</a>.</b> Whatever place
the measuring number has, reckoned from the unit, the same place
also has the number according to which it measures, reckoned from
the number measured, in the direction of the number before it.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX12.html">Proposition 12</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in
continued proportion, then by whatever prime numbers the last is
measured, the next to the unit is also measured by the same.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX13.html">Proposition 13</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in
continued proportion, and the number after the unit is prime, then
the greatest is not measured by any except those which have a place
among the proportional numbers.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX14.html">Proposition 14</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If a number is the least that is measured by prime numbers,
then it is not measured by any other prime number except those
originally measuring it.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX15.html">Proposition 15</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If three numbers in continued proportion are the least of those
which have the same ratio with them, then the sum of any two is
relatively prime to the remaining number.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX16.html">Proposition 16</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If two numbers are relatively prime, then the second is not to
any other number as the first is to the second.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX17.html">Proposition 17</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If there are as many numbers as we please in continued
proportion, and the extremes of them are relatively prime, then the
last is not to any other number as the first is to the second.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX18.html">Proposition 18</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>Given two numbers, to investigate whether it is possible to
find a third proportional to them.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX19.html">Proposition 19</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>Given three numbers, to investigate when it is possible to find
a fourth proportional to them.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX20.html">Proposition 20</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime
numbers.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX21.html">Proposition 21</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If as many even numbers as we please are added together, then
the sum is even.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX22.html">Proposition 22</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If as many odd numbers as we please are added together, and
their multitude is even, then the sum is even.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX23.html">Proposition 23</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If as many odd numbers as we please are added together, and
their multitude is odd, then the sum is also odd.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX24.html">Proposition 24</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If an even number is subtracted from an even number, then the
remainder is even.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX25.html">Proposition 25</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If an odd number is subtracted from an even number, then the
remainder is odd.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX26.html">Proposition 26</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If an odd number is subtracted from an odd number, then the
remainder is even.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX27.html">Proposition 27</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If an even number is subtracted from an odd number, then the
remainder is odd.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX28.html">Proposition 28</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If an odd number is multiplied by an even number, then the
product is even.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX29.html">Proposition 29</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If an odd number is multiplied by an odd number, then the
product is odd.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX30.html">Proposition 30</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If an odd number measures an even number, then it also measures
half of it.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX31.html">Proposition 31</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If an odd number is relatively prime to any number, then it is
also relatively prime to double it.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX32.html">Proposition 32</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>Each of the numbers which are continually doubled beginning
from a dyad is even-times even only.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX33.html">Proposition 33</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If a number has its half odd, then it is even-times odd
only.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX34.html">Proposition 34</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If an [even] number neither is one of those which is
continually doubled from a dyad, nor has its half odd, then it is
both even-times even and even-times odd.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="propIX35.html">Proposition 35</a>.</b></dt>
<dd>If as many numbers as we please are in continued proportion,
and there is subtracted from the second and the last numbers equal

<dd>If as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are set
out continuously in double proportion until the sum of all becomes
prime, and if the sum multiplied into the last makes some number,
then the product is perfect.</dd>
