<h1>Proposition 34</h1>
<div class="statement">If an [even] number neither is one of those
which is continually doubled from a dyad, nor has its half odd,
then it is both even-times-even and even-times-odd.</div>
<p>Let the [even] number <i>A</i> neither be one of those doubled
from a dyad, nor have its half odd.</p>
<p>I say that <i>A</i> is both even-times-even and
even-times-odd.</p>
<div class="ldiagram"><object height="60" width="200"><param name="background" value="35,19,100" />
 <param name="title" value="IX.34" />
 <param name="align" value="above" />
 <param name="e[1]" value="A0;point;free;-1000,30;0;0" />
 <param name="e[2]" value="A3;point;free;1000,30;0;0" />
 <param name="e[3]" value="A1;point;lineSlider;A0,A3,30,0;0" />
 <param name="e[4]" value="A2;point;lineSlider;A0,A3,160,0;0" />
 <param name="e[5]" value="A;line;connect;A1,A2;black" /></object></div>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVII/defVII6.html">VII.Def.8</a></div>
<p>Now that <i>A</i> is even-times-even is clear, for it has not
its half odd.</p>
<p>I say next that it is also even-times-odd.</p>
<p>If we bisect <i>A,</i> then bisect its half, and do this
continually, we shall come upon some odd number which measures
<i>A</i> according to an even number. If not, we shall come upon a
dyad, and <i>A</i> will be among those which are doubled from a
dyad, which is contrary to the hypothesis.</p>
<p>Thus <i>A</i> is even-times odd.</p>
<p>But it was also proved even-times-even. Therefore <i>A</i> is
both even-times-even and even-times-odd.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if an [even] number neither is one of those which
is continually doubled from a dyad, nor has its half odd, then it
is both even-times-even and even-times-odd.</i></p>
<div class="qed">Q.E.D.</div>

<h2>Guide</h2>
<p>Numbers which are both even-times-even and even-times-odd are
are both divisible by 4 and an odd number. They are the numbers
whose halves are even excluding powers of 2.</p>
<p>This completes the series of propositions on even and odd
numbers that started with <a href="propIX21.html">IX.21</a>.</p>
