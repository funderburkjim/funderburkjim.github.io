<p>I say that the sum <i>AE</i> is even.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVII/defVII6.html">VII.Def.6</a></div>
<p>Since each of the numbers <i>AB, BC, CD,</i> and <i>DE</i> is
even, therefore each has a half part, so that the sum <i>AE</i>
also has a half part. But an even number is that which is divisible
into two equal parts, therefore <i>AE</i> is even.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if as many even numbers as we please are added
together, then the sum is even.</i></p>

<h2>Guide</h2>
With this proposition, Euclid commences the study of even and odd
numbers. The study continues through proposition <a href="propIX34.html">IX.34</a>. The statements of these propositions
probably constitute the oldest part of the <i>Elements</i> and date
back to the Pythagoreans. Indeed, their proofs depend on no other
propositions (except <a href="propIX31.html">IX.31</a> which
discusses prime numbers and may have been inserted among these
propositions because it involves odd numbers), so that the
statements together with the proofs may be the oldest part of the
<i>Elements.</i>
<h4>Commutativity and associativity of addition</h4>
The proof of this proposition implicitly relies on a principle that
the order that numbers are summed is irrelevant. For example, when
showing that the sum of the two even numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
is even, first <i>a</i> is divided into two equal parts,
<i>a</i> = <i>c</i> + <i>c,</i> and <i>b</i> is
divided into two equal parts,
<i>b</i> = <i>d</i> + <i>d,</i> therefore
<center>
<i>a</i> + <i>b</i> = (<i>c</i> + <i>c</i>) + (<i>d</i> + <i>d</i>).</center>
<p>But to reach the conclusion that <i>a</i> + <i>b</i>
is divisible into two equal parts, we need</p>
<center>
<i>a</i> + <i>b</i> = (<i>c</i> + <i>d</i>) + (<i>c</i> + <i>d</i>),</center>
<p>which adds the terms in a different order.</p>
<p>Of course the order that the terms are added has no effect on
the sum. That is an implicit assumption made by Euclid and most
everyone after him until the 19th century.</p>
<p>The modern way to deal with this question is to recognize two
properties of addition of numbers. One of them is
<i>commutativity.</i> Addition is commutative since for any two
numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b,</i></p>
<center><i>a</i> + <i>b</i> = <i>b</i> + <i>a.</i></center>
<p>Commutativity says we can two numbers in any order and get the
same result.</p>
<p>The other property, <i>associativity,</i> is more subtle. When
computing the sum
<i>a</i> + <i>b</i> + <i>c</i> of three
numbers, there is still a choice of which numbers to add first. You
can either add <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> first to get <i>d,</i>
then add <i>d</i> + <i>c</i> to get the sum, or you can
add <i>b</i> + <i>c</i> first to get <i>e,</i> then add
<i>a</i> + <i>e</i> to get the sum. The same sum should
result. As an equation, associativity says you can move the
parentheses around:</p>
<center>(<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) + <i>c</i> = <i>a</i> + (<i>b</i> +
<i>c</i>).</center>
<p>These two properties, commutativity and associativity, are
enough to guarantee that when you add any number of terms together,
the order that they’re added is irrelvant.</p>
<p>These properties should either be taken as postulates about
numbers, or else proven from more basic assumptions. Besides these
properties of addition, Euclid missed some other basic properties
of the arithmetic operations.</p>
