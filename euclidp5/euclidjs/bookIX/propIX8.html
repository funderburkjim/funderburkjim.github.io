<h1>Proposition 8</h1>
<div class="statement">If as many numbers as we please beginning
from a unit are in continued proportion, then the third from the
unit is square as are also those which successively leave out one,
the fourth is cubic as are also all those which leave out two, and
the seventh is at once cubic and square are also those which leave
out five.</div>
<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, <i>A, B, C, D, E,</i>
and <i>F,</i> beginning from a unit and in continued
proportion.</p>

<p>I say that <i>B,</i> the third from the unit, is square as are
all those which leave out one; <i>C,</i> the fourth, is cubic as
are all those which leave out two; and <i>F,</i> the seventh, is at
once cubic and square as are all those which leave out five.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVII/defVII20.html">VII.Def.20</a></div>
<p>Since the unit is to <i>A</i> as <i>A</i> is to <i>B,</i>
therefore the unit measures the number <i>A</i> the same number of
times that <i>A</i> measures <i>B.</i> But the unit measures the
number <i>A</i> according to the units in it, therefore <i>A</i>
also measures <i>B</i> according to the units in <i>A.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVIII/propVIII22.html">VIII.22</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>A</i> multiplied by itself makes <i>B,</i>
therefore <i>B</i> is square. And, since <i>B, C,</i> and <i>D</i>
are in continued proportion, and <i>B</i> is square, therefore
<i>D</i> is also square. For the same reason <i>F</i> is also
square.</p>
<p>Similarly we can prove that all those which leave out one are
square.</p>
<p>I say next that <i>C,</i> the fourth from the unit, is cubic are
also all those which leave out two.</p>
<p>Since the unit is to <i>A</i> as <i>B</i> is to <i>C,</i>
therefore the unit measures the number <i>A</i> the same number of
times that <i>B</i> measures <i>C.</i> But the unit measures the
number <i>A</i> according to the units in <i>A,</i> therefore
<i>B</i> also measures <i>C</i> according to the units in <i>A.</i>
Therefore <i>A</i> multiplied by <i>B</i> makes <i>C.</i> Since
then <i>A</i> multiplied by itself makes <i>B,</i> and multiplied
by <i>B</i> makes <i>C,</i> therefore <i>C</i> is cubic.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVIII/propVIII23.html">VIII.23</a></div>
<p>And, since <i>C, D, E,</i> and <i>F</i> are in continued
proportion, and <i>C</i> is cubic, therefore <i>F</i> is also
cubic. But it was also proved square, therefore the seventh from
the unit is both cubic and square. Similarly we can prove that all
the numbers which leave out five are also both cubic and
square.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if as many numbers as we please beginning from a
unit are in continued proportion, then the third from the unit is
square as are also those which successively leave out one, the
fourth is cubic as are also all those which leave out two, and the
seventh is at once cubic and square are also those which leave out
five.</i></p>

<h2>Guide</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s unfortunate that Euclid didn't have the concept or notation
for exponentiation.</p>
<p>In the continued proportion</p>

<i>a</i><sup>3</sup>, <i>a</i><sup>4</sup>, <i>a</i><sup>5</sup>,

<p>every second, <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>, <i>a</i><sup>4</sup>,
