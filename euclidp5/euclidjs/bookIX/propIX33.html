<h1>Proposition 33</h1>
<div class="statement">If a number has its half odd, then it is
even-times-odd only.</div>
<p>Let the number <i>A</i> have its half odd.</p>
<p>I say that <i>A</i> is even-times-odd only.</p>
<div class="ldiagram"><object height="60" width="190"><param name="background" value="35,19,100" />
 <param name="title" value="IX.33" />
 <param name="align" value="above" />
 <param name="e[1]" value="A0;point;free;-1000,30;0;0" />
 <param name="e[2]" value="A3;point;free;1000,30;0;0" />
 <param name="e[3]" value="A1;point;lineSlider;A0,A3,30,0;0" />
 <param name="e[4]" value="A2;point;lineSlider;A0,A3,160,0;0" />
 <param name="e[5]" value="A;line;connect;A1,A2;black" /></object></div>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVII/defVII6.html">VII.Def.9</a></div>
<p>Now that it is even-times-odd is clear, for the half of it,
being odd, measures it an even number of times.</p>
<p>I say next that it is also even-times-odd only.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVII/defVII6.html">VII.Def.8</a></div>
<p>If <i>A</i> is even-times even also, then it is measured by an
even number according to an even number, so that the half of it is
also measured by an even number though it is odd, which is
absurd.</p>
<p>Therefore <i>A</i> is even-times-odd only.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if a number has its half odd, then it is
even-times-odd only.</i></p>
<div class="qed">Q.E.D.</div>

<h2>Guide</h2>
To say that a number is even-times-odd only means that it is
even-times-odd, but it is not even-times-even. As this proposition
states, such numbers are the numbers which are twice odd numbers.
