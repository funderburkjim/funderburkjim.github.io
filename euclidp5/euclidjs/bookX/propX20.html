<h1>Proposition 20</h1>
<div class="statement">If a rational area is applied to a rational
straight line, then it produces as breadth a straight line rational
and commensurable in length with the straight line to which it is
applied.</div>
<p>Let the rational area <i>AC</i> be applied to <i>AB</i>, a
straight line once more rational in any of the aforesaid ways,
producing <i>BC</i> as breadth.</p>

 <param name="e[8]" value="AC;polygon;parallelogram;A,B,C" /></object></div>
<p>I say that <i>BC</i> is rational and commensurable in length
with <i>BA</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI46.html">I.46</a>,
<a href="defX.I.html#4">X.Def.I.4</a></div>
<p>Describe the square <i>AD</i> on <i>AB</i>. Then <i>AD</i> is
rational.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVI/propVI1.html">VI.1</a><br />
<a href="propX11.html">X.11</a></div>
<p>But <i>AC</i> is also rational, therefore <i>DA</i> is
commensurable with <i>AC</i>. And <i>DA</i> is to <i>AC</i> as
<i>DB</i> is to <i>BC</i>. Therefore <i>DB</i> is also
commensurable with <i>BC</i>, and <i>DB</i> equals <i>BA</i>.
Therefore <i>AB</i> is also commensurable with <i>BC</i>.</p>
<p>But <i>AB</i> is rational, <i>C</i> therefore <i>BC</i> is also
rational and commensurable in length with <i>AB</i>.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if a rational area is applied to a rational
straight line, then it produces as breadth a straight line rational
and commensurable in length with the straight line to which it is
applied.</i></p>

<p>This proposition is a converse of the last, except that it’s
preceded by applying an area to a straight line to get the
rectangle. That would be more evident if it read “If one side of a
rational rectangle is rational, then the other side is rational and
commensurable with the first.”</p>
<p>It’s often easier to understand the statement and proof they’re
translated into modern language. Let <i>a</i> be the length of
<i>AB</i>, and <i>b</i> be the length of <i>BC</i>. Since the
rectangle <i>AC</i> is rational, that means its area <i>ab</i> is a
rational number. Since <i>AB</i> is a rational line, that means
<i>a</i><sup>2</sup> is a rational number. Therefore,
<i>a</i>/<i>b</i> is a rational number, that is, lines <i>AB</i>
and <i>BC</i> are commensurable. Also, <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> is a
rational number, that is, line <i>BC</i> is a rational line.</p>
