<h1>Proposition 6</h1>
<div class="statement">If two magnitudes have to one another the
ratio which a number has to a number, then the magnitudes are
commensurable.</div>
<p>Let the two magnitudes <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> have to one another
the ratio which the number <i>D</i> has to the number <i>E</i>.</p>
<p>I say that the magnitudes <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are
commensurable.</p>
<p>Divide <i>A</i> into as many equal parts as there are units in
<i>D</i>, and let <i>C</i> equal one of them, and let <i>F</i> be
made up of as many magnitudes equal to <i>C</i> as there are units
in <i>E</i>.</p>

<p>Since then there are in <i>A</i> as many magnitudes equal to
<i>C</i> as there are units in <i>D</i>, whatever part the unit is
of <i>D</i>, the same part is <i>C</i> of <i>A</i> also. Therefore
<i>C</i> is to <i>A</i> as the unit is to <i>D</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV7.html#cor">V.7,Cor.</a></div>
<p>But the unit measures the number <i>D</i>, therefore <i>C</i>
also measures <i>A</i>. And since <i>C</i> is to <i>A</i> as the
unit is to <i>D</i>, therefore, inversely, <i>A</i> is to <i>C</i>
as the number <i>D</i> is to the unit.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVII/defVII20.html">VII.Def.20</a></div>
<p>Again, since there are in <i>F</i> as many magnitudes equal to
<i>C</i> as there are units in <i>E</i>, therefore <i>C</i> is to
<i>F</i> as the unit is to <i>E</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV22.html">V.22</a></div>
<p>But it was also proved that <i>A</i> is to <i>C</i> as <i>D</i>
is to the unit, therefore, <i>ex aequali</i>, <i>A</i> is to
<i>F</i> as <i>D</i> is to <i>E</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV11.html">V.11</a></div>
<p>But <i>D</i> is to <i>E</i> as <i>A</i> is to <i>B</i>,
therefore <i>A</i> is to <i>B</i> as it is to <i>F</i> also.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV9.html">V.9</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>A</i> has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes
<i>B</i> and <i>F</i>. Therefore <i>B</i> equals <i>F</i>.</p>
<p>But <i>C</i> measures <i>F</i>, therefore it measures <i>B</i>
also. Further it measures <i>A</i> also, therefore <i>C</i>
measures <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="defX.I.html">X.Def.1</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>A</i> is commensurable with <i>B</i>.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if two magnitudes have to one another the ratio
which a number has to a number, then the magnitudes are
commensurable.</i></p>

<h1>Corollary</h1>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVI/propVI9.html">VI.9</a></div>
<p>From this it is clear that, <i>if there are two numbers as</i> D
and <i>E</i>, and a straight line as <i>A</i>, then it is possible
to make a straight line <i>F</i> such that the given straight line
is to it as the number <i>D</i> is to the number <i>E</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVI/propVI19.html#cor">VI.19,Cor.</a></div>
<p>And <i>if a mean proportional is also taken between</i> A and
<i>F</i>, as <i>B</i>, then <i>A</i> is to <i>F</i> as the square
on <i>A</i> is to the square on <i>B</i>, that is, the first is to
the third as the figure on the first is to that which is similar
and similarly described on the second.</p>
<p>But <i>A</i> is to <i>F</i> as the number <i>D</i> is to the
number <i>E</i>, therefore the number <i>D</i> is to the number
<i>E</i> as the figure on the straight line <i>A</i> is to the
figure on the straight line <i>B</i>.</p>
<div class="qed">Q.E.D.</div>
</div>
<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
<p>If <i>A</i> : <i>B</i> =
<i>m</i> : <i>n</i>, then, with <i>C</i> equal to
<i>A/m</i>, it follows that <i>A</i> = <i>mC</i> and <i>B</i> =
<i>nC</i>.</p>
<p>The proof assumes that magnitudes are divisible. Not all
magnitudes, however, are constructively divisible. For instance, a
60° angle cannot be trisected by a Euclidean construction. An
alternate proof which does not depend on divisibility of magnitudes
can be based on antenaresis.</p>
<p>Although the proposition refers to magnitudes of any kind, the
corollary only applies to lines in the first statement and plane
figures in the second.</p>
<h4>Use of this proposition</h4>
The proposition is used in very frequently in Book X starting with
the next proposition, its contrapositive. It is also used in
proposition <a href="../bookXIII/propXIII6.html">XIII.6</a>. The
corollary is also used frequently in Book X starting with <a href="propX10.html">X.10</a>.
