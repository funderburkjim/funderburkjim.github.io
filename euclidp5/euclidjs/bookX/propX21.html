<p>I say that <i>AC</i> is irrational, and the side of the square
equal to it is irrational, and let the latter be called medial.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="defX.I.html#4">X.Def.I.4</a></div>
<p>Describe the square <i>AD</i> on <i>AB</i>. Then <i>AD</i> is
rational.</p>
<p>And, since <i>AB</i> is incommensurable in length with
<i>BC</i>, for by hypothesis they are commensurable in square only,
while <i>AB</i> equals <i>BD</i>, therefore <i>DB</i> is also
incommensurable in length with <i>BC</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVI/propVI1.html">VI.1</a>,
<a href="propX11.html">X.11</a></div>
<p>And <i>DB</i> is to <i>BC</i> as <i>AD</i> is to <i>AC</i>,
therefore <i>DA</i> is incommensurable with <i>AC</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="defX.I.html#4">X.Def.I.4</a></div>
<p>But <i>DA</i> is rational, therefore <i>AC</i> is irrational, so
that the side of the square <i>AC</i> is also irrational.</p>
<p>Let the latter be called <i>medial</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
<p>The two lines <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are rational lines. That
means, according to Definition 3, that each is commensurable in
square to some unmentioned, standard straight line. It’s convenient
to assign that standard line a length of 1 and the standard square
on it a square of area 1. Euclid did not, but doing so allows us to
assign lengths to those lines. So if <i>a</i> is the length of
<i>AB</i>, that means <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> is a rational number,
that is, a ratio of two whole numbers. Likewise, if <i>b</i> is the
length of <i>BC</i>, then <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> is a rational
number.</p>
<p>Now <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are also commensurable in square
only. First of all, they’re commensurable in square, so the squares
on them are in a numeric ratio, and that means
<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>b</i><sup>2</sup> is a rational number,
which we already know since both <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> and
<i>b</i><sup>2</sup> are rational numbers themselves. But they’re
also commensurable in square <i>only</i>. That means that
<i>a</i>/<i>b</i> is an irrational number. In summary,
<i>a</i><sup>2</sup> and <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> are rational, but
<i>a</i>/<i>b</i> is irrational.</p>
<p>In the proof, it’s noted that the rectangle <i>AC</i> (which is
a <i>a</i> by <i>b</i> rectangle), is irrational, that is,
<i>ab</i> is an irrational number. The side of a square equal equal
to that rectangle is also irrational, and it’s called
<i>medial</i>. The length of that side is √(<i>ab</i>).</p>
<p>Another way of saying that is that the length √(<i>ab</i>) of a
medial line is the geometric mean of two numbers <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i> whose squares are rational and whose ratio is
irrational.</p>
<h4>Example and interpretation</h4>
<p>Let <i>AB</i> be the standard line and <i>BC</i> be the diagonal
of the standard square, then √(<i>ab</i>) = √(√2), the
4<sup>th</sup> root of 2.</p>
<p>In fact, all medial lines have lengths 4<sup>th</sup> roots of
rational numbers whose square roots are irrational. If
<i>a</i><sup>2</sup> and <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> are rational numbers
but <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> is an irrational number, then √(<i>ab</i>) is
a number whose fourth power,
<i>a</i><sup>2</sup><i>b</i><sup>2</sup>, is a rational number but
whose square, <i>ab</i>, is an irrational number.</p>
<p>Thus, we could call a number whose square is an irrational
number but whose fourth power is a rational number a <i>medial
number</i>.</p>
<h4>Medial squares and rectangles</h4>
<p>Only medial lines were defined in this proposition, but the
adjective medial is applied to squares and rectangles starting with
Proposition <a href="propX24.html">X.24</a>. From the way it is
used, we can tell that a <i>medial</i> square is one whose side is
a medial line, and a medial rectangle is one equal to a square
whose side is a medial line.</p>
<h4>Use of this proposition.</h4>
<p>This proposition is used frequently in Book X starting with the
next proposition.</p>
