</div>
<p>Then, if <i>BE</i> equals <i>ED,</i> then that which was
proposed is done, for a square <i>BD</i> has been constructed equal
to the rectilinear figure <i>A.</i></p>
<p>But, if not, one of the straight lines <i>BE</i> or <i>ED</i> is
greater.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI3.html">I.3</a>, <a href="../bookI/propI10.html">I.10</a></div>
<p>Let <i>BE</i> be greater, and produce it to <i>F.</i> Make
<i>EF</i> equal to <i>ED,</i> and bisect <i>BF</i> at <i>G.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/defI15.html">I.Def.18</a></div>
<p>Describe the semicircle <i>BHF</i> with center <i>G</i> and
radius one of the straight lines <i>GB</i> or <i>GF.</i> Produce
<i>DE</i> to <i>H,</i> and join <i>GH.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propII5.html">II.5</a></div>
<p>Then, since the straight line <i>BF</i> has been cut into equal
segments at <i>G</i> and into unequal segments at <i>E,</i> the
rectangle <i>BE</i> by <i>EF</i> together with the square on
<i>EG</i> equals the square on <i>GF.</i></p>
<p>But <i>GF</i> equals <i>GH,</i> therefore the rectangle
<i>BE</i> by <i>EF</i> together with the square on <i>GE</i> equals
the square on <i>GH.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI47.html">I.47</a></div>
<p>But the sum of the squares on <i>HE</i> and <i>EG</i> equals the
square on <i>GH,</i> therefore the rectangle <i>BE</i> by <i>EF</i>
together with the square on <i>GE</i> equals the sum of the squares
on <i>HE</i> and <i>EG.</i></p>
<p>Subtract the square on <i>GE</i> from each. Therefore the
remaining rectangle <i>BE</i> by <i>EF</i> equals the square on
<i>EH.</i></p>
<p>But the rectangle <i>BE</i> by <i>EF</i> is <i>BD,</i> for
<i>EF</i> equals <i>ED,</i> therefore the parallelogram <i>BD</i>
equals the square on <i>HE.</i></p>
<p>And <i>BD</i> equals the rectilinear figure <i>A.</i></p>
<p>Therefore the rectilinear figure <i>A</i> also equals the square
which can be described on <i>EH.</i></p>
<p>Therefore a square, namely that which can be described on
<i>EH,</i> has been constructed equal to the given rectilinear
figure <i>A.</i></p>

<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
The construction of a square equal to a given rectilinear figure is
short as described in the proof. The verification that this
construction works is also short with the help of Proposition
<a href="propII5.html">II.5</a> and Proposition <a href="../bookI/propI47.html">I.47</a>, the Pythagorean theorem. First,
Prop. II.5 allows us to convert the rectangle, <i>BE</i> by
<i>ED,</i> into the difference of two squares,
<i>GF</i><sup>2</sup> – <i>GE</i><sup>2</sup>. Note that
<i>GF</i> equals <i>GH,</i> the hypotenuse of a right triangle
<i>GHE.</i> Using I.47 we can replace the difference of two
squares, <i>GH</i><sup>2</sup> – <i>GE</i><sup>2</sup>,
by the single square, <i>EH</i><sup>2</sup>. Thus, the original
rectangle equals the square <i>EH</i><sup>2</sup>.
<h4>Quadrature of rectilinear figures</h4>
This proposition finishes the quadrature of rectilinear figures.
The narrow meaning of the word “quadrature” is to find a square
with the same area of a given figure, also called “squaring” the
figure. In a broader sense, quadrature means finding the area of a
given figure.
<p>Proposition <a href="../bookI/propI45.html">I.45</a> on
application of areas of rectilinear figures allows us to replace
the figure under question with a rectangle of the same area. Now,
the semicircle construction in this proposition finds what is
called the mean proportional between the sides of the rectangle. If
the sides of the rectangle are denoted <i>a</i> and <i>b,</i> then
the mean proportional <i>x</i> between them satisfies the
proportion
<i>a</i> : <i>x</i> = <i>x</i> : <i>b,</i>
and that’s equivalent to an equality of areas
<i>ab</i> = <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, that is to say, the
square on this mean proportional has the same area as the
rectangle. Thus, any rectilinear figure can be squared.</p>
<p>This result is an end in itself. It is not used in the rest of
the <i>Elements.</i></p>
<p>There is another proof of this proposition that is based on
similar triangles. Referring to the figure in the proposition, draw
lines <i>BH</i> and <i>BF,</i> and you’ll see three similar right
triangles: <i>BFH, BHE,</i> and <i>HGE.</i> From their similarity
it follows that
<i>BE</i> : <i>EH</i> = <i>EH</i> : <i>EF.</i>
That says <i>EH</i> is the required mean proportional.</p>
<p>Proportions aren’t developed until <a href="../bookV/bookV.html">Book V</a>, and similar triangles aren’t
mentioned until <a href="../bookVI/bookVI.html">Book VI</a>. So in
order to complete the theory of quadrature of rectilinear figures
early in the <i>Elements,</i> Euclid chose a different proof that
doesn’t depend on similar triangles. Note that this same result
appears in the garb of proportions in Proposition <a href="../bookVI/propVI13.html">VI.13</a>. Also in Book VI, Proposition
<a href="../bookVI/propVI17.html">VI.17</a> shows that the square
on the mean proportional equals the rectangle on the two straight
lines.</p>
<h4><a id="squaring" name="squaring">Squaring the circle</a></h4>
What about circles and other shapes? The general theory of circles
is treated in Book III, but there are no propositions about the
areas of circles until book XII. Proposition <a href="../bookXII/propXII2.html">XII.2</a> says the areas of circles are
proportional to the squares on their diameters. That allows the
area of two circles to be compared, but it doesn’t answer the
question “what’s the area of this circle?” in the same way that
this proposition does for rectilinear figures. That would require
finding a square equal to a given circle.
<p>This problem of quadrature of the circle was one of three famous
problems that goes back at least to the time of Anaxagoras, about
150 years before Euclid. It is equivalent to constructing a line
segment of length <i>π</i> (relative to a unit length). This
problem was solved by ancient Greek geometers but not by means of
the Euclidean tools of straightedge and compass; higher curves were
required. In fact, by the time of Pappus it was believed that the
circle could not be squared using only straightedge, compass, and,
furthermore, couldn’t be squared even with the help of the conic
sections (parabola, hyperbola, and ellipse). But the ancient Greeks
had no mathematical proof that it could not be squared.</p>
<p>That the circle could not be squared with Euclidean tools was
not shown until 1882 when Lindemann proved that <i>π</i> is a
transcendental number.</p>
