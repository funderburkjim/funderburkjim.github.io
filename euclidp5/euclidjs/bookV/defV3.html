<h1>Definition 3</h1>
<div class="statement">A <i>ratio</i> is a sort of relation in
respect of size between two magnitudes of the same kind.</div>
</div>
<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
A convenient notation for a ratio of two magnitudes <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i> of the same kind is <i>A</i> : <i>B.</i>
<h4>No mixed ratios</h4>
All of Euclid’s ratios are pure ratios of two magnitudes of the
<i>same</i> kind, in other words, there are no mixed ratios in the
<i>Elements.</i> A familiar example of a mixed ratio is velocity,
the ratio of a distance to a time, measured in units such as
kilometers/hour.
<p>That isn’t to say that ratios of different kinds of magnitudes
aren’t equated. In fact, that’s one of the more important aspects
of ratios. For example, the fundamental proposition of Book VI,
proposition <a href="../bookVI/propVI1.html">VI.1</a>, says that
given two triangles of the same height, the ratio of the triangles
<i>A</i> : <i>B</i> is the same as the ratio of their
heights <i>A</i><sub>h</sub>:<i>B</i><sub>h</sub>. That says that
the ratio of two plane figures equals the ratio of two lines.</p>
<p>Now, a common operation on proportions (equalities of ratios) is
that of alternation (see <a href="defV11.html">V.Def.12</a> and
<a href="propV16.html">V.16</a>) which in its general form says
that if
<i>A</i> : <i>B</i> = <i>C</i> : <i>D,</i>
then
<i>A</i> : <i>C</i> = <i>B</i> : <i>D.</i>
In the <i>Elements</i> alternation only applies when all four
quantities are of the same kind. But if alternation is applied to
the proportion of VI.1, then we get
<i>A</i> : <i>A</i><sub>h</sub> = <i>B</i> : <i>B</i><sub>h</sub>,
the equality of two mixed ratios, ratios of plane figures to lines.
This step, and the acceptance of mixed ratios, which seems to us
like a small thing, was not taken until centuries after Euclid.</p>
<h4>The nature of ratios</h4>
A ratio is a pair of magnitudes of the same kind considered as a
pair, but soon identified with other ratios. Definition 3 promises
that ratios have sizes, that is, given two ratios
<i>A</i> : <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> : <i>D,</i>
either the first ratio is greater, equal, or less than the second
ratio. That promise begins to be fulfilled in Definitions <a href="defV5.html">V.Def.5</a> and <a href="defV7.html">V.Def.7</a> where
equality and order of ratios defined. Note that equality and order
are defined for ratios, but they were assumed for numbers and
magnitudes.
<p>Since equality and order are defined, their expected properties
are proved in propositions, or at least some of the properties. For
example, proposition <a href="propV11.html">V.11</a> states that
two ratios that are the same as a third are the same as each other,
a statement analogous to <a href="../bookI/cn.html">C.N.1</a> for
magnitudes.</p>
<h4>Equivalence relations</h4>
(Equivalence relations were mentioned before in the <a href="../bookI/cn.html#guide">guide</a> for the Common Notions. It was
mentioned there that equality of magnitudes of the same kinds is an
equivalence relation.)
<p>The process used for defining ratios of magnitudes was something
new for Eudoxus and Euclid, but that process is now commonplace in
mathematics to construct new kinds of things. The process starts
with entities <i>x, y, z,</i> etc., that are well understood, such
as pairs of magnitudes of the same kind. Then a relation <i>E</i>
on these entities is found which is intended to be equality for
them. For ratios, that is given in <a href="defV5.html">V.Def.5</a>. Right now, let <i>xEy</i> denote that
<i>x</i> is related to <i>y</i> by the relation <i>E.</i> Next, it
is verified that the relation <i>E</i> is an <i>equivalence
relation,</i> that is, a reflexive, symmetric, and transitive
relation.</p>
<p>A relation <i>E</i> is <i>reflexive</i> if for any <i>x</i> it
is the case that <i>xEx,</i> that is, anything is related to itself
by <i>E.</i> A relation is <i>E</i> is <i>symmetric</i> if whenever
<i>xEy,</i> then <i>yEx.</i> And it is <i>transitive</i> if
whenever <i>xEy</i> and <i>yEz,</i> then <i>xEz.</i></p>
<p>Once <i>E</i> is known to be an equivalence relation, new
entities are conceived which are named by the old entities <i>x, y,
z,</i> etc., but the new entities are taken to be equal,
<i>x</i> = <i>y,</i> when their names are equivalent
under the relation <i>E,</i> that is, <i>xEy.</i> Proportion as an
equivalence relation is discussed in the <a href="defV5.html#guide">Guide</a> to definition V.Def.5.</p>
<h4>Operations on ratios and proportions, compounded ratios</h4>
There are several operations on ratios and proportions defined
soon. For instance, <a href="defV8.html">V.Def.9</a> defines
duplicate ratios, under certain assumptions, which may be thought
of as the squares of ratios. See also definitions <a href="defV11.html">V.Def.12</a> through V.18. But ratios are neither
numbers nor magnitudes, and the usual operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division that apply to numbers
don’t apply to ratios.
<p>Numbers can be added and subtracted, and so can magnitudes of
the same kind, but ratios cannot. Take for example a ratio
<i>A</i> : <i>B</i> of plane figures and a ratio
<i>C</i> : <i>D</i> of angles. What could be meant by
their sum
(<i>A</i> : <i>B</i>) + (<i>C</i> : <i>D</i>)?
One obvious approach is to treat ratios as quotients. That suggests
<i>A/B</i> + <i>C/D</i> = (<i>AD</i> + <i>BC</i>)/<i>BD,</i>
but a product of a plane figure and an angle, such as <i>AD,</i>
has no meaning, so the obvious approach has obvious
difficulties.</p>
<p>Multiplication and division are not automatic for ratios. Ratios
<i>A</i> : <i>B</i> and <i>B</i> : <i>C</i> are
<i>compounded</i> to form <i>A</i> : <i>C,</i> which may
be thought of as the product of the two ratios, and the duplicate
ratio mentioned above is a special case of a compound ratio. But
the compound of two ratios <i>A</i> : <i>B</i> and
<i>C</i> : <i>D</i> depends on the middle terms <i>B</i>
and <i>C</i> being the same. The proof of proposition <a href="propV18.html">V.18</a> assumes that fourth proportionals exist, a
property unjustified by any postulate, but if fourth proportionals
do exist, then the ratio <i>C</i> : <i>D</i> is equal to
some ratio <i>B</i> : <i>E,</i> and then the compound of
<i>A</i> : <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> : <i>D</i> is
the compound of <i>A</i> : <i>B</i> and
<i>B</i> : <i>E,</i> and that compound is
<i>A</i> : <i>E.</i> Thus, multiplication is an operation
when fourth proportionals exist. Division is also an operation when
fourth proportionals exist since <i>D</i> : <i>C</i> may
be thought of as the reciprocal of
<i>C</i> : <i>D.</i></p>
<h4>Ratios of various kinds</h4>
Several kinds of ratios appear in the <i>Elements.</i> There are
ratios of numbers, ratios of lines constructible in plane geometry,
ratios of rectilinear angles, ratios of plane figures constructible
in plane geometry, and ratios of solids.
<p>Numeric ratios, that is, ratios of numbers, are treated in the
books on number theory, Books VII through VIII. In modern
terminology these numeric ratios are called "positive rational
numbers." Numeric ratios and proportions have a separate, simpler
definition in <a href="../bookVII/defVII20.html">VII.Def.20</a>.
That definition is compatible with the definitions here in Book V,
but that compatibility is not demonstrated in the
<i>Elements.</i></p>
<table cellspacing="5">
<tr>
<td>The problem with numeric ratios is that there are not enough of
them. That is ratios of magnitudes are not always equal to ratios
of numbers.
<p>The illustration to the right shows a square with side <i>A</i>
and diameter <i>B.</i> The ratio <i>B</i> to <i>A</i> does exist
according to the next definition <a href="defV4.html">V.Def.4</a>
since some multiple of each is greater than the other. In modern
terms this ratio would be identified with the square root of 2 and
is known to be an irrational number, that is, it is not equal to a
numeric ratio. It is, nonetheless, a ratio in Euclid’s terminology.
The ratio <i>B</i> : <i>A</i> is a ratio of lines, but it
is not a ratio of numbers.</p>
<p>Since this and other ratios of lines are not ratios of numbers,
a more general definition of ratio is required. That more general
definition is the one given here and continuing through
V.Def.6.</p>

<p>In modern terminology, the numeric ratios are positive rational
numbers. The field of all rational numbers including 0 and the
negative rational numbers is commonly denoted <b>Q</b>. The ratios
of lines constructible in plane geometry form the field extended
from <b>Q</b> by closure under square roots. A convenient notation
for that field is <b>Q</b><sup>√</sup>. It is a much larger field,
but does not include all real numbers. For instance, the cube root
of 2, needed for doubling a cube, the sine of 20°, needed for
trisecting angles, and pi, needed for squaring the circle, all are
missing from <b>Q</b><sup>√</sup>.</p>
<p>The conic sections are part of solid geometry but they are not
treated in the <i>Elements.</i> Cones are discussed in Book XII,
but their sections (intersections with planes) which include
ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas are not even defined in the
<i>Elements.</i> Euclid’s work on the <i>Conics</i> was superseded
by Apollonius’ and no longer exists. Intersections of conics lead
to lines of new lengths that can be used to solve problems such as
doubling a cube and trisecting an angle, but they don’t help in
squaring the circle. Thus, there are more ratios of lines
constructible in solid geometry than ratios of lines constructible
in plane geometry.</p>
<p>The ratios of rectilinear figures form the same field
<b>Q</b><sup>√</sup> as the ratios of lines. This follows from the
theory of application of areas developed in Book I, see proposition
<a href="../bookI/propI44.html">I.44</a>. But there are other plane
figures besides rectilinear ones: circles. The ratio of a circle to
the square on its radius is <i>π</i>. Thus, <i>π</i> is a ratio of
plane figures even though it is not a ratio of lines.</p>
<h4>Ratios of more than two terms</h4>
Throughout Book V the only ratios that are considered are those
with two terms in accordance with V.Def.3, but in Book VII ratios
of three or more terms are used in proposition <a href="../bookVII/propVII33.html">VI.33</a>. In that proposition, a ratio
<i>A</i> : <i>B</i> : <i>C</i> of three numbers
is considered, and a certain proportion
<i>A</i> : <i>B</i> : <i>C</i> = <i>E</i> : <i>F</i> : <i>G</i>
is shown. These multiterm ratios and proportions are probably left
over from an earlier time. In any case, the multiterm proportion
may be interpreted as an abbreviation for two proportions
<i>A</i> : <i>B</i> = <i>E</i> : <i>F</i>
and
<i>B</i> : <i>C</i> = <i>F</i> : <i>G.</i>
Then it follows <i>ex aequali</i> that
<i>A</i> : <i>C</i> = <i>E</i> : <i>G.</i>
