<h1>Proposition 8</h1>
<div class="statement">If in a right-angled triangle a
perpendicular is drawn from the right angle to the base, then the
triangles adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole
and to one another.</div>
<p>Let <i>ABC</i> be a right-angled triangle having the angle
<i>BAC</i> right, and let <i>AD</i> be drawn from <i>A</i>
perpendicular to <i>BC.</i></p>
<p>I say that each of the triangles <i>DBA</i> and <i>DAC</i> is
similar to the whole <i>ABC,</i> and, further, they are similar to
one another.</p>

<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI32.html">I.32</a></div>
<p>Since the angle <i>BAC</i> equals the angle <i>BDA,</i> for each
is right, and the angle at <i>B</i> is common to the two triangles
<i>ABC</i> and <i>DBA,</i> therefore the remaining angle <i>ACB</i>
equals the remaining angle <i>DAB.</i> Therefore the triangle
<i>ABC</i> is equiangular with the triangle <i>DBA.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propVI4.html">VI.4</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>BC,</i> which is opposite the right angle in the
triangle <i>ABC,</i> is to <i>BA,</i> which is opposite the right
angle in the triangle <i>DBA,</i> as <i>AB,</i> which is opposite
the angle at <i>C</i> in the triangle <i>ABC,</i> is to <i>DB,</i>
which is opposite the equal angle <i>BAD</i> in the triangle
<i>DBA,</i> and also as <i>AC</i> is to <i>DA,</i> which is
opposite the angle at <i>B</i> common to the two triangles.</p>
<p>Therefore the triangle <i>ABC</i> is both equiangular to the
triangle <i>DBA</i> and has the sides about the equal angles
proportional.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="defVI1.html">VI.Def.1</a></div>
<p>Therefore the triangle <i>ABC</i> is similar to the triangle
<i>DBA.</i></p>
<p>In the same manner we can prove that the triangle <i>DAC</i> is
also similar to the triangle <i>ABC.</i> Therefore each of the
triangles <i>DBA</i> and <i>DAC</i> is similar to the whole
<i>ABC.</i></p>
<p>I say next that the triangles <i>DBA</i> and <i>DAC</i> are also
similar to one another.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI32.html">I.32</a></div>
<p>Since the right angle <i>BDA</i> equals the right angle
<i>ADC,</i> and moreover the angle <i>DAB</i> was also proved equal
to the angle at <i>C,</i> therefore the remaining angle at <i>B</i>
also equals the remaining angle <i>DAC.</i> Therefore the triangle
<i>DBA</i> is equiangular with the triangle <i>ADC.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propVI4.html">VI.4</a><br />
<a href="defVI1.html">VI.Def.1</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>BD,</i> which is opposite the angle <i>DAB</i> in
the triangle <i>DBA,</i> is to <i>AD,</i> which is opposite the
angle at <i>C</i> in the triangle <i>DAC</i> equal to the angle
<i>DAB,</i> as <i>AD,</i> itself which is opposite the angle at
<i>B</i> in the triangle <i>DBA,</i> is to <i>CD,</i> which is
opposite the angle <i>DAC</i> in the triangle <i>DAC</i> equal to
the angle at <i>B,</i> and also as <i>BA</i> is to <i>AC,</i> these
sides opposite the right angles. Therefore the triangle <i>DBA</i>
is similar to the triangle <i>DAC.</i></p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular is
drawn from the right angle to the base, then the triangles
adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole and to
one another.</i></p>

<h1>Corollary</h1>
<div class="statement">From this it is clear that, if in a
right-angled triangle a perpendicular is drawn from the right angle
to the base, then the straight line so drawn is a mean proportional
between the segments of the base.</div>

Essentially, triangles <i>ABC</i> and <i>DBA</i> are equiangular
since they are right triangles with a common angle. Therefore, they
are similar. Likewise, triangles <i>ABC</i> and <i>DAC</i> are
similar.
<p>Note that Euclid verbosely draws from proposition <a href="propVI4.html">VI.4</a> the conclusions that equiangular triangles
are similar and that triangles similar to the same triangle are
similar to each other. The general proposition that figures similar
to the same figure are also similar to one another is proposition
<a href="propVI21.html">VI.21</a>. There is no reason why that
proposition could not have been placed before this one.</p>
<p>This proposition may be used to give an alternate proof of
proposition <a href="../bookI/propI47.html">I.47</a>. Indeed,
Euclid presents such a proof in the <a href="../bookX/propX33.html#lemma">lemma</a> for X.33. That proof is
probably older than Euclid’s as given in I.47, but Euclid’s proof
has the advantage of not being dependent on Eudoxus’ theory of
proportion in Book V.</p>
<p>This proposition and its corollary are used in propositions
<a href="propVI13.html">VI.13</a>, <a href="propVI31.html">VI.31</a>, <a href="../bookX/propX33.html">X.33</a>, and often in Book XIII.</p>
