<h1>Proposition 5</h1>
<div class="statement">In equal triangles which have one angle
equal to one angle the sides about the equal angles are
reciprocally proportional; and those triangles which have one angle
equal to one angle, and in which the sides about the equal angles
are reciprocally proportional, are equal.</div>
<p>Let <i>ABC</i> and <i>ADE</i> be equal triangles having one
angle equal to one angle, namely the angle <i>BAC</i> equal to the
angle <i>DAE.</i></p>
<p>I say that in the triangles <i>ABC</i> and <i>ADE</i> the sides
about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, that is to
say, that <i>CA</i> is to <i>AD</i> as <i>EA</i> is to
<i>AB.</i></p>
<div class="ldiagram"><object height="270" width="270"><param name="background" value="35,19,100" />
 <param name="title" value="VI.15" />
 <param name="e[1]" value="A;point;free;140,110" />
 <param name="e[2]" value="B;point;free;80,30" />
 <param name="e[3]" value="C;point;free;30,200" />

<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI14.html">I.14</a></div>
<p>Place them so that <i>CA</i> is in a straight line with
<i>AD.</i> Therefore <i>EA</i> is also in a straight line with
<i>AB.</i></p>
<p>Join <i>BD.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV7.html">V.7</a></div>
<p>Since then the triangle <i>ABC</i> equals the triangle
<i>ADE,</i> and <i>ABD</i> is another triangle, therefore the
triangle <i>ABC</i> is to the triangle <i>ABD</i> as the triangle
<i>ADE</i> is to the triangle <i>ABD.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propVI1.html">VI.1</a></div>
<p>But <i>ABC</i> is to <i>ABD</i> as <i>AC</i> is to <i>AD,</i>
and <i>ADE</i> is to <i>ABD</i> as <i>AE</i> is to <i>AB.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV11.html">V.11</a></div>
<p>Therefore also <i>AC</i> is to <i>AD</i> as <i>AE</i> is to
<i>AB.</i></p>
<p>Therefore in the triangles <i>ABC</i> and <i>ADE</i> the sides
about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.</p>
<hr width="50%" />
<p>Next, let the sides of the triangles <i>ABC</i> and <i>ADE</i>
be reciprocally proportional, that is to say, let <i>AE</i> be to
<i>AB</i> as <i>CA</i> is to <i>AD.</i></p>
<p>I say that the triangle <i>ABC</i> equals the triangle
<i>ADE.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propVI1.html">VI.1</a><br />
<a href="../bookV/propV11.html">V.11</a></div>
<p>If <i>BD</i> is again joined, since <i>AC</i> is to <i>AD</i> as
<i>AE</i> is to <i>AB,</i> while <i>AC</i> is to <i>AD</i> as the
triangle <i>ABC</i> is to the triangle <i>ABD,</i> and <i>AE</i> is
to <i>AB</i> as the triangle <i>ADE</i> is to the triangle
<i>ABD,</i> therefore the triangle <i>ABC</i> is to the triangle
<i>ABD</i> as the triangle <i>ADE</i> is to the triangle
<i>ABD.</i></p>
<p>Therefore each of the triangles <i>ABC</i> and <i>ADE</i> has
the same ratio to <i>ABD.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV9.html">V.9</a></div>
<p>Therefore the triangle <i>ABC</i> equals the triangle
<i>ADE.</i></p>
<p>Therefore, <i>in equal triangles which have one angle equal to
one angle the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally
proportional; and those triangles which have one angle equal to one
angle, and in which the sides about the equal angles are
reciprocally proportional, are equal.</i></p>
