<h1>Proposition 1</h1>
<div class="statement">Two unequal magnitudes being set out, if
from the greater there is subtracted a magnitude greater than its
half, and from that which is left a magnitude greater than its
half, and if this process is repeated continually, then there will
be left some magnitude less than the lesser magnitude set
out.</div>
<p>Let <i>AB</i> and <i>C</i> be two unequal magnitudes of which
<i>AB</i> is the greater.</p>
<p>I say that, if from <i>AB</i> there is subtracted a magnitude
greater than its half, and from that which is left a magnitude
greater than its half, and if this process is repeated continually,
then there will be left some magnitude which is less than the
magnitude <i>C</i>.</p>
<div class="just">cf. <a href="../bookV/defV4.html">V.Def.4</a></div>
<p>Some multiple <i>DE</i> of <i>C</i> is greater than
<i>AB</i>.</p>
<p>Divide <i>DE</i> into the parts <i>DF</i>, <i>FG</i>, and
<i>GE</i> equal to <i>C</i>. From <i>AB</i> subtract <i>BH</i>
greater than its half, and from <i>AH</i> subtract <i>HK</i>
greater than its half, and repeat this process continually until
the divisions in <i>AB</i> are equal in multitude with the
divisions in <i>DE</i>.</p>

<p>Let, then, <i>AK</i>, <i>KH</i>, and <i>HB</i> be divisions
equal in multitude with <i>DF</i>, <i>FG</i>, and <i>GE</i>.</p>
<p>Now, since <i>DE</i> is greater than <i>AB</i>, and from
<i>DE</i> there has been subtracted <i>EG</i> less than its half,
and, from <i>AB</i>, <i>BH</i> greater than its half, therefore the
remainder <i>GD</i> is greater than the remainder <i>HA</i>.</p>
<p>And, since <i>GD</i> is greater than <i>HA</i>, and there has
been subtracted from <i>GD</i> the half <i>GF</i>, and from
<i>HA</i>, <i>HK</i> greater than its half, therefore the remainder
<i>DF</i> is greater than the remainder <i>AK</i>.</p>
<p>But <i>DF</i> equals <i>C</i>, therefore <i>C</i> is also
greater than <i>AK</i>. Therefore <i>AK</i> is less than
<i>C</i>.</p>
<p>Therefore there is left of the magnitude <i>AB</i> the magnitude
<i>AK</i> which is less than the lesser magnitude set out, namely
<i>C</i>.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>two unequal magnitudes being set out, if from the
greater there is subtracted a magnitude greater than its half, and
from that which is left a magnitude greater than its half, and if
this process is repeated continually, then there will be left some
magnitude less than the lesser magnitude set out.</i></p>
<div class="qed">Q.E.D.</div>
<p>And the theorem can similarly be proven even if the parts
subtracted are halves.</p>

<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
The proof begins with two magnitudes <i>C</i> and <i>AB</i> and
claims that some multiple of <i>C</i> is greater then <i>AB</i>.
Definition <a href="../bookV/defV4.html">V.Def.4</a> is not a
justification for this statement. Euclid himself proved that a horn
angle is less than any rectilinear angle in proposition <a href="../bookIII/propIII16.html">III.16</a> and must have recognized
that if the magnitude <i>C</i> is a horn angle, and the magnitude
<i>AB</i> is a rectilinear angle, then no multiple of <i>C</i> is
greater than <i>AB</i>. Nonetheless, he did not qualify this
proposition to say that it only holds for certain kinds of
magnitudes.
<h4>Use of this proposition</h4>
This proposition is the foundation of the method of exhaustion of
Book XII. It is not used in the rest of Book X and would, perhaps,
be better placed at the beginning of Book XII. This method is used
in the propositions concerning areas of circles and volumes of
solids. It is specifically used in propositions <a href="../bookXII/propXII2.html">XII.2</a>, <a href="../bookXII/propXII5.html">XII.5</a>, <a href="../bookXII/propXII10.html">XII.10</a>, <a href="../bookXII/propXII11.html">XII.11</a>, <a href="../bookXII/propXII12.html">XII.12</a>, and <a href="../bookXII/propXII16.html">XII.16</a>.
