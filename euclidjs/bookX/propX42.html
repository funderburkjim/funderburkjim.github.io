<h1>Proposition 42</h1>
<div class="statement">A binomial straight line is divided into its
terms at one point only.</div>
<p>Let <i>AB</i> be a binomial straight line divided into its terms
at <i>C</i>. Then <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> are rational straight
lines commensurable in square only.</p>
<p>I say that <i>AB</i> is not divided at another point into two
rational straight lines commensurable in square only.</p>
<p>For, if possible, let it be divided at <i>D</i> also, so that
<i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> are also rational straight lines
commensurable in square only.</p>
<div class="ldiagram"><object height="70" width="260"><param name="background" value="35,19,100" />
 <param name="title" value="X.42" />
 <param name="align" value="above" />
 <param name="e[1]" value="A0;point;free;-1000,40;0;0" />
 <param name="e[2]" value="A3;point;free;1000,40;0;0" />
 <param name="e[3]" value="A;point;lineSlider;A0,A3,30,0" />
 <param name="e[4]" value="B;point;lineSlider;A0,A3,220,0" />
 <param name="e[5]" value="AB;line;connect;A,B;0;0" />
 <param name="e[6]" value="C;point;lineSlider;A0,A3,170,0" />
 <param name="e[7]" value="D;point;lineSlider;A0,A3,130,0" /></object></div>
<p>It is then manifest that <i>AC</i> is not the same as
<i>DB</i>.</p>
<p>If possible, let it be so. Then <i>AB</i> is also the same as
<i>CB</i>, and <i>AC</i> is to <i>CB</i> as <i>BD</i> is to
<i>DA</i>. Thus <i>AB</i> is divided at <i>D</i> also in the same
way as by the division at <i>C</i>, which is contrary to the
hypothesis.</p>
<p>Therefore <i>AC</i> is not the same with <i>DB</i>.</p>
<p>For this reason also the points <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> are not
equidistant from the point of bisection.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookII/propII4.html">II.4</a></div>
<p>Therefore that by which the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and
<i>CB</i> differs from the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and
<i>DB</i> is also that by which twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by
<i>DB</i> differs from twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i>,
because both the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> together with
twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i>, and the squares on
<i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> together with twice the rectangle <i>AD</i>
by <i>DB</i>, equal the square on <i>AB</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="propX21.html">X.21</a><br />
<a href="propX26.html">X.26</a></div>
<p>But the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> differs
from the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> by a
rational area, for both are rational, therefore twice the rectangle
<i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> also differs from twice the rectangle
<i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i> by a rational area, though they are medial,
which is absurd, for a medial area does not exceed a medial by a
rational area.</p>
<p>Therefore a binomial straight line is not divided at different
points. Therefore it is divided at one point only.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>a binomial straight line is divided into its terms
at one point only.</i></p>
