<h1>Proposition 9</h1>
<div class="statement">The squares on straight lines commensurable
in length have to one another the ratio which a square number has
to a square number; and squares which have to one another the ratio
which a square number has to a square number also have their sides
commensurable in length. But the squares on straight lines
incommensurable in length do not have to one another the ratio
which a square number has to a square number; and squares which do
not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a
square number also do not have their sides commensurable in length
either.</div>
<p>Let <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> be commensurable in length.</p>
<p>I say that the square on <i>A</i> has to the square on <i>B</i>
the ratio which a square number has to a square number.</p>

<div class="just"><a href="propX5.html">X.5</a></div>
<p>Since <i>A</i> is commensurable in length with <i>B</i>,
therefore <i>A</i> has to <i>B</i> the ratio which a number has to
a number. Let it have to it the ratio which <i>C</i> has to
<i>D</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVI/propVI20.html#cor">VI.20,Cor.</a><br />
<a href="../bookVIII/propVIII11.html">VIII.11</a></div>
<p>Since then <i>A</i> is to <i>B</i> as <i>C</i> is to <i>D</i>,
while the ratio of the square on <i>A</i> to the square on <i>B</i>
is duplicate of the ratio of <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>, for similar
figures are in the duplicate ratio of their corresponding sides,
and the ratio of the square on <i>C</i> to the square on <i>D</i>
is duplicate of the ratio of <i>C</i> to <i>D</i>, for between two
square numbers there is one mean proportional number, and the
square number has to the square number the ratio duplicate of that
which the side has to the side, therefore the square on <i>A</i> is
to the square on <i>B</i> as the square on <i>C</i> is to the
square on <i>D</i>.</p>
<hr width="50%" />
<p>Next, as the square on <i>A</i> is to the square on <i>B</i>, so
let the square on <i>C</i> be to the square on <i>D</i>.</p>
<p>I say that <i>A</i> is commensurable in length with
<i>B</i>.</p>
<p>Since the square on <i>A</i> is to the square on <i>B</i> as the
square on <i>C</i> is to the square on <i>D</i>, while the ratio of
the square on <i>A</i> to the square on <i>B</i> is duplicate of
the ratio of <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>, and the ratio of the square on
<i>C</i> to the square on <i>D</i> is duplicate of the ratio of
<i>C</i> to <i>D</i>, therefore <i>A</i> is to <i>B</i> as <i>C</i>
is to <i>D</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="propX6.html">X.6</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>A</i> has to <i>B</i> the ratio which the number
<i>C</i> has to the number <i>D</i>. Therefore <i>A</i> is
commensurable in length with <i>B</i>.</p>
<hr width="50%" />
<p>Next, let <i>A</i> be incommensurable in length with
<i>B</i>.</p>
<p>I say that the square on <i>A</i> does not have to the square on
<i>B</i> the ratio which a square number has to a square
number.</p>
<div class="just">Above</div>
<p>If the square on <i>A</i> does have to the square on <i>B</i>
the ratio which a square number has to a square number, then
<i>A</i> is commensurable with <i>B</i>.</p>
<p>But it is not, therefore the square on <i>A</i> does not have to
the square on <i>B</i> the ratio which a square number has to a
square number.</p>
<hr width="50%" />
<p>Finally, let the square on <i>A</i> not have to the square on
<i>B</i> the ratio which a square number has to a square
number.</p>
<p>I say that <i>A</i> is incommensurable in length with
<i>B</i>.</p>
<div class="just">Above</div>
<p>For, if <i>A</i> is commensurable with <i>B</i>, then the square
on <i>A</i> has to the square on <i>B</i> the ratio which a square
number has to a square number.</p>
<p>But it does not, therefore <i>A</i> is not commensurable in
length with <i>B</i>.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>the squares on straight lines commensurable in
length have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a
square number; and squares which have to one another the ratio
which a square number has to a square number also have their sides
commensurable in length. But the squares on straight lines
incommensurable in length do not have to one another the ratio
which a square number has to a square number; and squares which do
not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a
square number also do not have their sides commensurable in length
either.</i></p>

<h1>Corollary</h1>

<div class="just"><a href="../bookVIII/propVIII26.html">VIII.26</a>
and converse</div>
<p>It has been proved in the arithmetical books that <i>similar
plane numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number
has to a square number, and that, if two numbers have to one
another the ratio which a square number has to a square number,
then they are similar plane numbers.</i></p>

<a id="cor2" name="cor2" />
<div class="theorem">
<h1>Corollary 2</h1>
<div class="statement">And it is clear from these propositions that
<i>numbers which are not similar plane numbers, that is, those
which do not have their sides proportional, do not have to one
another the ratio which a square number has to a square
number</i></div>
.
<p>For, if they have, then they are similar plane numbers, which is
contrary to the hypothesis. Therefore numbers which are not similar
plane numbers do not have to one another the ratio which a square
number has to a square number.</p>
</div>
<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
<p>Propositions <a href="propX5.html">X.5</a> through X.8 stated
that lines are commensurable if and only if they they had a numeric
ratio, that is a ratio of a number to another. This proposition
states that lines are commensurable if and only if the squares on
them have a ratio of a square number to another square number.</p>
<p>For example, the diagonal of a square and the side of the square
are not commensurable since the squares on them are in the ratio
2:1, and 2:1 is not the ratio of a square number to a square
number, see the guide to proposition <a href="../bookVIII/propVIII8.html">VIII.8</a>.</p>
<h4>Numbers as magnitudes</h4>
<p>As in the proof of X.5, again there is the assumption that
numbers are magnitudes. For example, toward the beginning of the
proof there is the following argument: Since the ratio of
magnitudes <i>A</i> : <i>B</i> equals the ratio of
numbers <i>C</i> : <i>D</i>, and the ratio of the square
on <i>A</i> to the square on <i>B</i> (a ratio of two plane
figures) is duplicate of the ratio <i>A</i> : <i>B</i>,
and the ratio of the square on <i>C</i> to the square on <i>D</i>
(a ratio of two numbers) is duplicate of the ratio
<i>C</i> : <i>D</i>, therefore the ratio of the square on
<i>A</i> to the square on <i>B</i> equals the ratio of the square
on <i>C</i> to the square on <i>D</i>.</p>
<p>Such a conclusion is warranted if numbers are magnitudes, but if
they are, then several of the propositions in Book V fail since
they rely on the existence of fourth proportionals.</p>
<p>In the second stage of the proof of the proposition, the
converse is argued: Since the squares are proportional, therefore
<i>A</i> : <i>B</i> = <i>C</i> : <i>D</i>.
A separate proposition should be supplied with a proof to justify
that step.</p>
<h4>Use of this proposition</h4>
<p>The proposition is used repeatedly in Book X starting with the
next. It is also used in Book XIII in propositions <a href="../bookXIII/propXIII6.html">XIII.6</a> and <a href="../bookXIII/propXIII11.html">XIII.11</a>.</p>
