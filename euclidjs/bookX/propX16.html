<h1>Proposition 16</h1>
<div class="statement">If two incommensurable magnitudes are added
together, the sum is also incommensurable with each of them; but,
if the sum is incommensurable with one of them, then the original
magnitudes are also incommensurable.</div>
<p>Let the two incommensurable magnitudes <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i>
be added together.</p>
<p>I say that the whole <i>AC</i> is also incommensurable with each
of the magnitudes <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i>.</p>
<p>For, if <i>CA</i> and <i>AB</i> are not incommensurable, then
some magnitude <i>D</i> measures them.</p>

<p>Since then <i>D</i> measures <i>CA</i> and <i>AB</i>, therefore
it also measures the remainder <i>BC</i>. But it also measures
<i>AB</i>, therefore <i>D</i> measures <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i>.
Therefore <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are commensurable, but they were
also, by hypothesis, incommensurable, which is impossible.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="defX.I.html#1">X.Def.I.1</a></div>
<p>Therefore no magnitude measures <i>CA</i> and <i>AB</i>.
Therefore <i>CA</i> and <i>AB</i> are incommensurable.</p>
<p>Similarly we can prove that <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> are also
incommensurable. Therefore <i>AC</i> is incommensurable with each
of the magnitudes <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i>.</p>
<hr width="50%" />
<p>Next, let <i>AC</i> be incommensurable with one of the
magnitudes <i>AB</i> or <i>BC</i>.</p>
<p>First, let it be incommensurable with <i>AB</i>.</p>
<p>I say that <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are also incommensurable.</p>
<p>For, if they are commensurable, then some magnitude <i>D</i>
measures them.</p>
<p>Since, then, <i>D</i> measures <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i>,
therefore it also measures the whole <i>AC</i>. But it also
measures <i>AB</i>, therefore <i>D</i> measures <i>CA</i> and
<i>AB</i>. Therefore <i>CA</i> and <i>AB</i> are commensurable, but
they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable, which is
impossible.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="defX.I.html#1">X.Def.I.1</a></div>
<p>Therefore no magnitude measures <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i>.
Therefore <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are incommensurable.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if two incommensurable magnitudes are added
together, the sum is also incommensurable with each of them; but,
if the sum is incommensurable with one of them, then the original
magnitudes are also incommensurable.</i></p>

This proposition is a logical variant of the previous one, but it
is proved afresh. It is used in several others in Book X starting
with <a href="propX18.html">X.18</a>.
