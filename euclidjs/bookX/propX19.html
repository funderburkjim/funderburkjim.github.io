<h1>Proposition 19</h1>
<div class="theorem"><a id="lemma" name="lemma" />
<h3>Lemma.</h3>
<p>Since it has been proved that straight lines commensurable in
length are always commensurable in square also, while those
commensurable in square are not always commensurable in length
also, but can of course be either commensurable or incommensurable
in length, it is manifest that, if any straight line is
commensurable in length with a given rational straight line, it is
called rational and commensurable with the other not only in length
but in square also, since straight lines commensurable in length
are always commensurable in square also.</p>
<p>But, if any straight line is commensurable in square with a
given rational straight line, then, if it is also commensurable in
length with it, in this case it is also called rational and
commensurable with it both in length and in square, but, if again
any straight line, being commensurable in square with a given
rational straight line, is incommensurable in length with it, in
this case it is also called rational but commensurable in square
only.</p>

<div class="statement">The rectangle contained by rational straight
lines commensurable in length is rational.</div>
<p>Let the rectangle <i>AC</i> be contained by the rational
straight lines <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> commensurable in length.</p>

<a href="defX.I.html#4">X.Def.I.4</a></div>
<p>Describe the square <i>AD</i> on <i>AB</i>. Then <i>AD</i> is
rational.</p>
<p>And, since <i>AB</i> is commensurable in length with <i>BC</i>,
while <i>AB</i> equals <i>BD</i>, therefore <i>BD</i> is
commensurable in length with <i>BC</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVI/propVI1.html">VI.1</a></div>
<p>And <i>BD</i> is to <i>BC</i> as <i>DA</i> is to <i>AC</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="propX11.html">X.11</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>DA</i> is commensurable with <i>AC</i>.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="defX.I.html#4">X.Def.I.4</a></div>
<p>But <i>DA</i> is rational, therefore <i>AC</i> is also
rational.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>the rectangle contained by rational straight lines
commensurable in length is rational.</i></p>

<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
This is the first proposition that deals with rational lines and
rational squares. As required by definitions <a href="defX.I.html#3">X.Def.I.3</a> and <a href="defX.I.html#3">X.Def.I.3</a>, there is some assigned straight line
to act as a standard to which other lines and squares are compared
for rationality. That line is usually not mentioned in the
propositions.
<p>In this proposition, it is assumed that both sides of the
rectangle <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are rational lines. That means
these lines are commensurable in square to the standard line, that
is, their squares are commensurable with the standard square. It is
also assumed that <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are commensurable with
each other. Therefore the rectangle <i>AC</i> is commensurable with
the square on <i>AB</i>, but thatâ€™s commensurable with the standard
square, so the rectangle <i>AC</i> is too.</p>
<p>The proposition is used several times starting with <a href="propX25.html">X.25</a>. The lemma is used in <a href="propX23.html">X.23</a>.</p>
<p>The next proposition is a converse of this one, but the language
obscures that from notice.</p>
