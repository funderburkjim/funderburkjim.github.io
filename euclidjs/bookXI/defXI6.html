<h1>Definition 6</h1>
<div class="statement">The inclination of a plane to a plane is the
acute angle contained by the straight lines drawn at right angles
to the intersection at the same point, one in each of the
planes.</div>

<div class="theorem">
<h1>Definition 7</h1>
<div class="statement">A plane is said to be similarly inclined to
a plane as another is to another when the said angles of the
inclinations equal one another.</div>

<div class="theorem">
<h1>Definition 8</h1>
<div class="statement">Parallel planes are those which do not
meet.</div>

<h2>Guide</h2>
As the previous definition requires certain assumptions, so does
definition 6. It assumes that any two such acute angles are equal,
something Euclid does not prove but could have in the course of
Book XI.
<p>Definition 8 is analogous to definition <a href="../bookI/defI23.html">I.23</a> for parallel lines in a plane.
There is no proposition in Book XI which states that parallelism of
planes is a transitive relation, but that is not difficult to prove
given the rest of the propositions in the book. The first
appearance of parallel planes is in proposition <a href="propXI14.html">XI.14</a>.</p>
<p>When two planes are not parallel, then, by this definition, they
intersect. Proposition <a href="propXI3.html">XI.3</a> proclaims
that this intersection is a straight line.</p>
<p>Note that it is not defined when a line is parallel to a plane,
but that would be when they donâ€™t meet.</p>
