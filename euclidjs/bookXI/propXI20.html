<h1>Proposition 20</h1>
<div class="statement">If a solid angle is contained by three plane
angles, then the sum of any two is greater than the remaining
one.</div>
<p>Let the solid angle at <i>A</i> be contained by the three plane
angles <i>BAC, CAD,</i> and <i>DAB.</i></p>
<p>I say that the sum of any two of the angles <i>BAC, CAD,</i> and
<i>DAB</i> is greater than the remaining one.</p>

 <param name="e[9]" value="E;point;intersection;B,C,A,E'" />

<p>If the angles <i>BAC, CAD,</i> and <i>DAB</i> are equal to one
another, then it is clear that the sum of any two is greater than
the remaining one.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI23.html">I.23</a><br />
<a href="../bookI/propI3.html">I.3</a></div>
<p>But, if not, let <i>BAC</i> be greater. In the plane through
<i>BA</i> and <i>AC,</i> construct the angle <i>BAE</i> equal to
the angle <i>DAB</i> at the point <i>A</i> on the straight line
<i>AB.</i> Make <i>AE</i> equal to <i>AD,</i> draw <i>BEC</i>
across through the point <i>E</i> cutting the straight lines
<i>AB</i> and <i>AC</i> at the points <i>B</i> and <i>C,</i> and
join <i>DB</i> and <i>DC.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI4.html">I.4</a></div>
<p>Now, since <i>DA</i> equals <i>AE,</i> and <i>AB</i> is common,
therefore two sides are equal to two sides. And the angle
<i>DAB</i> equals the angle <i>BAE,</i> therefore the base
<i>DB</i> equals the base <i>BE.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI20.html">I.20</a></div>
<p>And, since the sum of the two sides <i>BD</i> and <i>DC</i> is
greater than <i>BC,</i> and of these <i>DB</i> was proved equal to
<i>BE,</i> therefore the remainder <i>DC</i> is greater than the
remainder <i>EC.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI25.html">I.25</a></div>
<p>Now, since <i>DA</i> equals <i>AE,</i> and <i>AC</i> is common,
and the base <i>DC</i> is greater than the base <i>EC,</i>
therefore the angle <i>DAC</i> is greater than the angle
<i>EAC.</i></p>
<p>But the angle <i>BAE</i> equals the angle <i>DAB,</i> therefore
the sum of the angles <i>DAB</i> and <i>DAC</i> is greater than the
angle <i>BAC.</i></p>
<p>Similarly we can prove that the sum of any two of the remaining
angles is greater than the remaining one.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if a solid angle is contained by three plane
angles, then the sum of any two is greater than the remaining
one.</i></p>

<h2>Guide</h2>
This is one of two necessary conditions for constructing a solid
angle out of three plane angles. The next necessary condition is
stated in the next proposition, and the two conditions together are
shown to be sufficient in <a href="propXI23.html">XI.23</a>.
<h4>About the proof</h4>
The structure of the proof is not entirely clear. The goal is to
show that the sum of any two of the angles is greater than the
third. Notice is made that if they are all equal, then the goal is
clearly satisfied. Then, under the assumption that if one is
greater than a second, then the sum of the second and third is
greater than the first. Then the other cases are declared to be
similarly provable.
<p>Various interpretations have been made of the intent of the form
of proof, but all require minor changes to clarify the
structure.</p>
<h4>About three-dimensional analogues of two-dimensional
constructions</h4>
Up until this proposition, each construction in Book XI takes place
within a plane, although different constructions in the same
proposition may occur in different planes. One of the constructions
here, however, takes place in two different planes. The angle
<i>BAE</i> is constructed in one plane to equal a given angle
<i>DAB</i> in a different plane. The construction in <a href="../bookI/propI23.html">I.23</a> to construct one angle equal to a
given angle, strictly speaking, takes place in only one plane.
Tracing that construction back through Book I leads through
proposition <a href="../bookI/propI22.html">I.22</a> to <a href="../bookI/propI3.html">I.3</a>. Proposition I.3 cuts one line off
equal to another line. That basic construction can easily be
modified so that the two lines are in different planes. Once thatâ€™s
done, the rest of the constructions in Book I also apply when their
components lie in different planes. Still, the details should be
verified before applying the results as done in the proof of this
proposition.
