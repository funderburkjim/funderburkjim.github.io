<p>Since the two parallel planes <i>BG</i> and <i>CE</i> are cut by
the plane <i>AC,</i> therefore their common sections are parallel.
Therefore <i>AB</i> is parallel to <i>DC.</i> Again, since the two
parallel planes <i>BF</i> and <i>AE</i> are cut by the plane
<i>AC,</i> therefore their intersections are parallel. Therefore
<i>BC</i> is parallel to <i>AD.</i></p>
<p>But <i>AB</i> was proved parallel to <i>DC,</i> therefore
<i>AC</i> is a parallelogram. Similarly we can prove that each of
the planes <i>DF, FG, GB, BF,</i> and <i>AE</i> is a
parallelogram.</p>
<p>Join <i>AH</i> and <i>DF.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propXI10.html">XI.10</a></div>
<p>Then, since <i>AB</i> is parallel to <i>DC,</i> and <i>BH</i> is
parallel to <i>CF,</i> therefore the two straight lines <i>AB</i>
and <i>BH,</i> which meet one another, are parallel to the two
straight lines <i>DC</i> and <i>CF,</i> which meet one another, not
in the same plane. Therefore they contain equal angles. Therefore
the angle <i>ABH</i> equals the angle <i>DCF.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI34.html">I.34</a><br />
<a href="../bookI/propI4.html">I.4</a></div>
<p>And, since the two sides <i>AB</i> and <i>BH</i> equal the two
sides <i>DC</i> and <i>CF,</i> and the angle <i>ABH</i> equals the
angle <i>DCF,</i> therefore the base <i>AH</i> equals the base
<i>DF,</i> and the triangle <i>ABH</i> equals the triangle
<i>DCF.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI34.html">I.34</a></div>
<p>And the parallelogram <i>BG</i> is double the triangle
<i>ABH,</i> and the parallelogram <i>CE</i> is double the triangle
<i>DCF,</i> therefore the parallelogram <i>BG</i> equals the
parallelogram <i>CE.</i></p>
<p>Similarly we can prove that <i>AC</i> equals <i>GF,</i> and
<i>AE</i> equals <i>BF.</i></p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if a solid is contained by parallel planes, then
the opposite planes in it are equal and parallelogrammic.</i></p>

<h2>Guide</h2>
The statement of the theorem is not sufficiently detailed. All
three of the octahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron (see
<a href="defXI25.html">XI.Def.26-28</a>) are contained by parallel
planes, but their faces are triangles or pentagons, not
parallelograms. They do not have six faces, however, but eight,
twenty, or twelve.
<p>The correct hypothesis for this proposition is that the solid is
contained by three pairs of parallel planes. Then the intersection
of each plane with the other four nonparallel planes can be shown
to be sides of a parallelgram, and the parallelograms on opposite
planes can be shown to be congruent, what Euclid would call similar
and equal parallelograms. That the opposite parallelograms are not
just equal but also similar should be stated in the conclusion of
the proposition.</p>
<h4>Parallelepipeds</h4>
The term “parallelepipedal solid,” abbreviated as “parallelepiped,”
is used for the solid treated by this proposition. It can be
defined as a solid bounded by three pairs of parallel faces. Then
this proposition shows that a parallelepiped has the further
properties that each face is a parallelogram, and opposite
parallelograms have parallel and equal corresponding sides, and
equal corresponding angles.
<p>Parallelepipeds are to solid geometry what parallelograms are to
plane geometry. This proposition is the analogue of proposition
<a href="../bookI/propI34.html">I.34</a> which introduces
parallelograms just as this proposition introduces parallelepipeds.
It is likely that both are the product of Euclid’s own
research.</p>
<h4>Use of this proposition</h4>
This proposition is used in the next as well as others in this book
and the next.
