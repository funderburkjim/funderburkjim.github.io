<h1>Definition 20</h1>
<div class="statement">Numbers are <i>proportional</i> when the
first is the same multiple, or the same part, or the same parts, of
the second that the third is of the fourth.</div>
</div>
<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
<p>Definition V.20 for proportionality of numbers is not the same
as the definition of proportionality for magnitudes in <a href="../bookV/bookV.html">Book V</a> given in <a href="../bookV/defV5.html">V.Def.5</a>. This definition for numbers was
probably the earlier one, but as not all magnitudes are
commensurable, it cannot adequately define proportionality for
magnitudes.</p>
<p>This definition VII.20 is given by cases. The various cases
correspond to definitions <a href="defVII3.html">VII.Def.3</a>
through VII.Def.6 for part, parts, and multiple.</p>
<p>When four numbers, <i>a, b, c,</i> and <i>d,</i> are
proportional, that will be written in these guides symbolically as
<i>a</i> : <i>b</i> = <i>c</i> : <i>d</i>.</p>
<p>In the first case of Definition 20, <i>a</i> is the same
multiple of <i>b</i> as <i>c</i> is of <i>d.</i> An example of this
is the proportion 12 : 6 = 22 : 11,
where 12 is twice 6 and 22 is twice 11.</p>
<p>The second case is inverse to the first, <i>a</i> is the same
part of <i>b</i> as <i>c</i> is of <i>d.</i> For an example take
the proportion 6 : 12 = 11 : 22,
where 6 is one half of 12, and 11 is one half of 22.</p>
<p>For an example of the third case, consider
12 : 16 = 21 : 28. Since the first is
the same parts of the second, namely 3 parts of 4, as the the third
is of the fourth, the proportion holds.</p>
<h4>Ratios of numbers</h4>
Although the word “ratio” doesn’t appear in this definition, it
appears frequently beginning in proposition <a href="propVII14.html">VII.14</a>. In book VII ratio is restricted to the
use of saying when one ratio is the same as another, that is, there
is a proportion as defined in this definition. In Book VIII,
duplicate ratios, triplicate ratios, and other compounded ratios
appear. Definitions for these concepts are not explicitly given,
but once the concept of proportion has been defined, they have the
same definition given in Book V for duplicate and triplicate ratio
in <a href="../bookV/defV8.html">V.Def.9-10</a>. Compound ratios
aren’t defined in Book V, but they can be understood by their use.
See the <a href="../bookV/defV3.html#guide">Guide to V.Def.3</a>.
Various other definitions that go along with ratios and proportions
were given in <a href="../bookV/bookV.html">Book V</a>, for
instance, alternate ratios, inverse ratios, taken jointly, taken
separately, and <i>ex aequali.</i> These definitions are also not
repeated here in Book VII.
<p>Very soon in these books on number theory Euclid begins to rely
on properties of proportion proved in Book V using the other
definition of proportion. That these are valid for proportions of
numbers could be verified individually or by showing that the two
definitions of proportion are equivalent for numbers.</p>
<h4>Use of this definition</h4>
Proportions of numbers first appear in proposition <a href="propVII11.html">VII.11</a>, but all the propositions from <a href="propVII4.html">VII.4</a> through <a href="propVII10.html">VII.10</a> are in preparation for the study of
numeric proportions.
