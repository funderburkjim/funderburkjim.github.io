<h1>Definition 22</h1>
<div class="statement">A <i>perfect number</i> is that which is
equal to the sum of its own parts.</div>
</div>
<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
For example, the number 28 is perfect because its parts (that is,
proper divisors) 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 sum to 28. The four smallest
perfect numbers were known to the ancient Greek mathematicians.
They are 6, 28, 496, and 8128. In proposition <a href="../bookIX/propIX36.html">IX.36</a> Euclid gives a construction of
even perfect numbers. For more discussion on perfect numbers, see
the <a href="../bookIX/propIX36.html#guide">Guide</a> for the that
proposition.
<p>The divisors of these even perfect numbers can be listed in two
columns, illustrated here for the divisors of 496.</p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr align="right">
<td><br />
1<br />
2<br />
4<br />
8<br />
16</td>
<td><br />
31<br />
62<br />
124<br />
248<br />
    (496)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>The first column lists powers of 2 from 2<sup>0</sup> up through
2<sup>4</sup>. The sum of these powers of 2 is 31, which is one
less than 2<sup>5</sup>. That number 31 appears at the top of the
second column, and its repeated doubles up through 496 appear on
the second column. In such a tableau, the sum of all the numbers,
except the last, will equal the last.</p>
<p>The question of odd perfect numbers was not solved by Euclid.
Probably the oldest open conjecture in mathematics is that there
are no odd perfect numbers. There is no proof yet, but it is known
that if there is an odd perfect number, then it has to be immensely
huge.</p>
