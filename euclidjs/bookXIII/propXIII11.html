<div class="just"><a href="../bookIII/propIII1.html">III.1</a><br />

<p>Take the center <i>F</i> of the circle, join <i>AF</i> and
<i>FB</i> and carry them through to the points <i>G</i> and
<i>H,</i> join <i>AC,</i> and make <i>FK</i> a fourth part of
<i>AF.</i></p>
<p>Now <i>AF</i> is rational, therefore <i>FK</i> is also rational.
But <i>BF</i> is also rational, therefore the whole <i>BK</i> is
rational.</p>
<p>And, since the circumference <i>ACG</i> equals the circumference
<i>ADG,</i> and in them <i>ABC</i> equals <i>AED,</i> therefore the
remainder <i>CG</i> equals the remainder <i>GD.</i></p>
<p>And, if we join <i>AD,</i> then we conclude that the angles at
<i>L</i> are right, and <i>CD</i> is double <i>CL.</i></p>
<p>For the same reason the angles at <i>M</i> are also right, and
<i>AC</i> is double <i>CM.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI32.html">I.32</a></div>
<p>Since then the angle <i>ALC</i> equals the angle <i>AMF,</i> and
the angle <i>LAC</i> is common to the two triangles <i>ACL</i> and
<i>AMF,</i> therefore the remaining angle <i>ACL</i> equals the
remaining angle <i>MFA.</i></p>
<p>Therefore the triangle <i>ACL</i> is equiangular with the
triangle <i>AMF.</i> Therefore, proportionally <i>LC</i> is to
<i>CA</i> as <i>MF</i> is to <i>FA.</i> Taking the doubles of the
antecedents, therefore double <i>LC</i> is to <i>CA</i> as double
<i>MF</i> to <i>FA.</i></p>
<p>But double <i>MF</i> is to <i>FA</i> as <i>MF</i> is to the half
of <i>FA,</i> therefore also double <i>LC</i> is to <i>CA</i> as
<i>MF</i> is to the half of <i>FA.</i></p>
<p>Taking the halves of the consequents, therefore double <i>LC</i>
is to the half of <i>CA</i> as <i>MF</i> to the fourth of
<i>FA.</i></p>
<p>And <i>DC</i> is double <i>LC, CM</i> is half of <i>CA,</i> and
<i>FK</i> is a fourth part of <i>FA,</i> therefore <i>DC</i> is to
<i>CM</i> as <i>MF</i> to <i>FK.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV18.html">V.18</a></div>
<p>Taken together, the sum of <i>DC</i> and <i>CM</i> is to
<i>CM</i> as <i>MK</i> to <i>KF.</i> Therefore the square on the
sum of <i>DC</i> and <i>CM</i> is to the square on <i>CM</i> as the
square on <i>MK</i> is to the square on <i>KF.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propXIII8.html">XIII.8</a><br />
<a href="propXIII1.html">XIII.1</a></div>
<p>And since, when the straight line opposite two sides of the
pentagon <i>AC</i> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, the greater
segment equals the side of the pentagon, that is, <i>DC,</i> while
the square on the greater segment added to the half of the whole is
five times the square on the half of the whole, and <i>CM</i> is
half of the whole <i>AC,</i> therefore the square on <i>DC</i> and
<i>CM</i> taken as one straight line is five times the square on
<i>CM.</i></p>
<p>But it was proved that the square on <i>DC</i> and <i>CM</i>
taken as one straight line is to the square on <i>CM</i> as the
square on <i>MK</i> to the square on <i>KF,</i> therefore the
square on <i>MK</i> is five times the square on <i>KF.</i></p>
<p>But the square on <i>KF</i> is rational, for the diameter is
rational, therefore the square on <i>MK</i> is also rational.
Therefore <i>MK</i> is rational.</p>
<p>And, since <i>BF</i> is quadruple <i>FK,</i> therefore <i>BK</i>
is five times <i>KF.</i> Therefore the square on <i>BK</i> is
twenty-five times the square on <i>KF.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookX/propX9.html">X.9</a></div>
<p>But the square on <i>MK</i> is five times the square on
<i>KF,</i> therefore the square on <i>BK</i> is five times the
square on <i>KM.</i> Therefore the square on <i>BK</i> has not to
the square on <i>KM</i> the ratio which a square number has to a
square number. Therefore <i>BK</i> is incommensurable in length
with <i>KM.</i></p>
<p>And each of them is rational. Therefore <i>BK</i> and <i>KM</i>
are rational straight lines commensurable in square only.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookX/propX73.html">X.73</a></div>
<p>But, if from a rational straight line there is subtracted a
rational straight line which is commensurable with the whole in
square only, then the remainder is irrational, namely an apotome,
therefore <i>MB</i> is an apotome and <i>MK</i> the annex to
it.</p>
<p>I say next that <i>MB</i> is also a fourth apotome.</p>
<p>Let the square on <i>N</i> be equal to that by which the square
on <i>BK</i> is greater than the square on <i>KM.</i> Therefore the
square on <i>BK</i> is greater than the square on <i>KM</i> by the
square on <i>N.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookX/propX15.html">X.15</a><br />
<a href="../bookX/propX12.html">X.12</a></div>
<p>And, since <i>KF</i> is commensurable with <i>FB,</i> taken
together, <i>KB</i> is commensurable with <i>FB.</i> But <i>BF</i>
is commensurable with <i>BH,</i> therefore <i>BK</i> is also
commensurable with <i>BH.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV19.html#cor">V.19,Cor.</a><br />
<a href="../bookX/propX9.html">X.9</a></div>
<p>And, since the square on <i>BK</i> is five times the square on
<i>KM,</i> therefore the square on <i>BK</i> has to the square on
<i>KM</i> the ratio which 5 has to 1. Therefore, in conversion, the
square on <i>BK</i> has to the square on <i>N</i> the ratio which 5
has to 4, and this is not the ratio which a square number has to a
square number. Therefore <i>BK</i> is incommensurable with
<i>N.</i> Therefore the square on <i>BK</i> is greater than the
square on <i>KM</i> by the square on a straight line
incommensurable with <i>BK.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookX/defX.III.html#4">X.Def.III.4</a></div>
<p>Since then the square on the whole <i>BK</i> is greater than the
square on the annex <i>KM</i> by the square on a straight line
incommensurable with <i>BK,</i> and the whole <i>BK</i> is
commensurable with the rational straight line, <i>BH,</i> set out,
therefore <i>MB</i> is a fourth apotome.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookX/propX94.html">X.94</a></div>
<p>But the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a
fourth apotome is irrational, and its square root is irrational,
and is called minor.</p>
<p>But the square on <i>AB</i> equals the rectangle <i>HB</i> by
<i>BM,</i> because, when <i>AH</i> is joined, the triangle
<i>ABH</i> is equiangular with the triangle <i>ABM,</i> and
<i>HB</i> is to <i>BA</i> as <i>AB</i> is to <i>BM.</i></p>
<p>Therefore the side <i>AB</i> of the pentagon is the irrational
straight line called minor.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if an equilateral pentagon is inscribed in a
circle which has its diameter rational, then the side of the
pentagon is the irrational straight line called minor.</i></p>
