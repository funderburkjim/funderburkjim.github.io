<h1>Proposition 9</h1>
<div class="statement">If as many numbers as we please beginning
from a unit are in continued proportion, and the number after the
unit is square, then all the rest are also square; and if the
number after the unit is cubic, then all the rest are also
cubic.</div>
<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, <i>A, B, C, D, E,</i>
and <i>F,</i> beginning from a unit and in continued proportion,
and let <i>A,</i> the number after the unit, be square.</p>

<p>I say that all the rest are also square.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="propIX8.html">IX.8</a></div>
<p>Now it was proved that <i>B,</i> the third from the unit, is
square as are all those which leave out one.</p>
<p>I say that all the rest are also square.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVIII/propVIII22.html">VIII.22</a></div>
<p>Since <i>A, B,</i> and <i>C</i> are in continued proportion, and
<i>A</i> is square, therefore <i>C</i> is also square. Again, since
<i>B, C,</i> and <i>D</i> are in continued proportion, and <i>B</i>
is square, therefore <i>D</i> is also square. Similarly we can
prove that all the rest are also square.</p>
<p>Next, let <i>A</i> be a cube.</p>
<p>I say that all the rest are also cubes.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="propIX8.html">IX.8</a></div>
<p>Now it was proved that <i>C,</i> the fourth from the unit, is a
cube as are all those which leave out two.</p>
<p>I say that all the rest are also cubic.</p>
<p>Since the unit is to <i>A</i> as <i>A</i> is to <i>B,</i>
therefore the unit measures <i>A</i> the same number of times as
<i>A</i> measures <i>B.</i> But the unit measures <i>A</i>
according to the units in it, therefore <i>A</i> also measures
<i>B</i> according to the units in itself, therefore <i>A</i>
multiplied by itself makes <i>B.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propIX3.html">IX.3</a></div>
<p>And <i>A</i> is cubic. But, if cubic number multiplied by itself
makes some number, then the product is also a cube, therefore
<i>B</i> is also a cube.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="../bookVIII/propVIII23.html">VIII.23</a></div>
<p>And, since the four numbers <i>A, B, C,</i> and <i>D</i> are in
continued proportion, and <i>A</i> is a cube, therefore <i>D</i>
also is a cube.</p>
<p>For the same reason <i>E</i> is also a cube, and similarly all
the rest are cubes.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if as many numbers as we please beginning from a
unit are in continued proportion, and the number after the unit is
square, then all the rest are also square; and if the number after
the unit is cubic, then all the rest are also cubic.</i></p>

<h2>Guide</h2>
This proposition says that if a number is a square then all its
powers are squares, too. Likewise, the powers of cubes are cubes.
<p>The following theorem is a converse of this one.</p>
