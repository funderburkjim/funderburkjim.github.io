<h1>Proposition 22</h1>
<div class="statement">If as many odd numbers as we please are
added together, and their multitude is even, then the sum is
even.</div>
<p>Let as many odd numbers as we please, <i>AB, BC, CD,</i> and
<i>DE,</i> even in multitude, be added together.</p>
<p>I say that the sum <i>AE</i> is even.</p>

<p>Since each of the numbers <i>AB, BC, CD,</i> and <i>DE</i> is
odd, if a unit is subtracted from each, then each of the remainders
is even, so that the sum of them is even. But the multitude of the
units is also even. Therefore the sum <i>AE</i> is also even.</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>if as many odd numbers as we please are added
together, and their multitude is even, then the sum is
even.</i></p>

<h2>Guide</h2>
A critical step in the proof is the claim that if 1 is subracted
from an odd number, then the remainder is even. This was mentioned
in <a href="../bookVII/defVII6.html">VII.Def.7</a>, but never
proved. See the <a href="../bookVII/defVII6.html#guide">Guide</a>
for that definition for details. Unless that gap is filled, this
proposition, along with many that depend upon it, are unjustified.
