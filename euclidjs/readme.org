* DIFFERENCES from Java
** DONE propI12.html 
Point F does not draw a vertex, but it has a black vertex in Java.
Similarly for points E and G.
The reason has to do with how Java initializes an 'int'.
Namely, Java 'int dimension;' sets the value of 'dimension' to the integer 0.
However, 'var dimension;' sets the value of 'dimension' to 'undefined'.
So changed, in Element.js, the default value of dimension to 0.
Then, in Geometry.js, in the determination of vertexColor, this '0' value
comes into play, so that a Point, whose vertexColor is not otherwise determined,
has a dimension == 0, so gets a vertexColor of Black.

* maketidybookscript
in v07 directory:
python maketidybookscript.py bookI html

  for each such X.

* v06 process to transform clarkhtml files
Run this from the vxx directory
* sh euclidtidy.sh elements.html 
 &rsquo; does not display properly in the tidied file.
 It is transformed to proper utf-8 code, BUT ..
 There seems to be no option in tidy to get the '<meta charset="utf-8" />'
 inserted into the output.
 The little program euclidtidy.py does this, along with a few other things

sh euclidtidy.sh bookI/bookI.html
tidy ../clarkhtml/copyright.htlm

tidy ../clarkhtml/bookI/
* clark.sh

* v05 concatenate the files
  sh redo.sh  creates a file euclidbundle.js, by concatenating numerous javascript files.
  This file is loaded by a script statement in the html file.
  The html file is as constructed by applying tidy to one of Clark's html files.
  (see 'USING TIDY' below for discussion)
** here are the lines that load all of my Javascript:
  <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="../../js/jquery-3.0.0.min.js"></script>
  <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="../../js/p5.js"></script>
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="../euclidbundle.js"></script>

These lines may be put at the end of the <head> section of the html.
** what other changes to the html?
  The 'java:disabled' lines should be omitted, or commented out:
<!-- we don't want this alternate  ejf
<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
if (!navigator.javaEnabled()) document.getElementById('ap1').innerHTML =
  '<img src="post1.gif" hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="Post.1">';
//]]>
</script> -->

** next step:
  make a program which:
  (a) runs tidy on one of clarkhtml .html files, generating xhtml
      and in same file name relative to v0x directory
  (b) Python file modifies by adding/removing lines to this tidied html file
  (c) checks the end result by xmllint.

* Starting Python webserver
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
* v01
 Similar to v00, but further encapsulates
* v02
  Add keyPressed, to reset when 'r','R' or ' ' key is pressed.
* download of images
There are many gifs (600 or so) in Clark's pages that use applets.
Generally, for any <applet>, there is a corresponding gif.
If a user doesn't have Java enabled, then the gif is shown instead.
For this section, we concentrate on loading the images. 
The strategy is to generate a shell script that will use 'curl' to download the images.
First, we generate a text file with the image statements:
grep -r '<img' clarkhtml > work/imgsrc.txt 
This usually contains each <img> statement twice, once within the applet tag, and
once within a javascript <script> whose purpose is to use the image if Java applet not functioning.
We edit imgsrc.txt, and retain only those <img> tags within the applet tag; save result as imgsrc1.txt


* Using the gifs, discussion
For instance 
<div id="ap1">
<applet code=Geometry codebase="../../Geometry" archive=Geometry.zip height=150 width=250>
<img src="defI10.gif" alt="java applet or image">
<param ...>
...
</div>
<script>
if (!navigator.javaEnabled()) document.getElementById('ap1').innerHTML =
  '<img src="defI10.gif" hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="I.Def.10">';
</script>

The <noscript> tag should allow this kind of variation when a browser doesn't support javascript.

* USING TIDY
tidy --output-xhtml yes --numeric-entities yes --output-encoding utf8 -o temp-xhtml.html ../clarkhtml/bookI/post1.html
There are numerous errors or 'slack' coding present in the clarhtml  html files.
This version of tidy seems to generate equivalent and syntactically correct html output;
for 'xmllint --noout temp-xhtml.html'  shows no errors.

Note: 'tidy' program is present automatically in MacOSX. This is an 'Apple' version.
The comparison of this apple version with 'official' versions of tidy (from the 
 html-tidy.org web site) is not spelled out, but the various options used as above seem to work.
